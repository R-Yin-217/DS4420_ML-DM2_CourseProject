UpperWestSide,1.0,Not looking for anything lavish. Just marigolds to celebrate d√≠a de los muertos 
UpperWestSide,0.78,"Hello,

I am a dude and keep relatively short 2c/3a hair. I'm looking for recs of places to get a haircut. I looked at some older posts and saw most people suggested vacating the neighborhood when it comes to getting a cut: but so then, where *do* yall go? I'm willing to travel \~30 min by public transit.

Also, I'm making this post because I'd like to ask specifically for places that are less female-oriented and/or cheaper. I don't necessarily have an issue with going to a place that is 90% women, but:

1. I think prices at those kinds of salons assume that I have enough hair (and stylistic ambition and vision) to occupy 90+ minutes of stylist time
2. I'd rather pay like $20 less and have the place not be instagram-worthy
3. I'm just generally not interested in getting caught in the cross-fire of women pink taxing each other hahaha.

At the same time, I appreciate that an even $65 haircut is probably too good to be true here.

I already have a shortlist of [Ouidad](https://flagshipsalons.ouidad.com/), [Filament](https://filamenthairsalon.com/about/), and [Bloom Beauty Lounge](https://www.bloombeautylounge.com/) as safe bets, but they all seem a bit overkill for what I'd need. After all, as my dad taught me, there's no better barber than the two weeks following a haircut. Cutting my hair isn't rocket science, but I do need someone who won't just like, slam the auto-crew cut button and isn't a complete stranger to non-Protestant hair.

TYIA!

  
edit: thank you all very much for the abundant replies, I appreciate it."
UpperWestSide,0.9,Anyone know where you can cut across Central Park to get over to the top of Cat Hill / East Drive around the met? Not sure what entrances to the park are open. Any other locals have preferred spots to see family racing? 
UpperWestSide,0.92,"A guy was just shot in the leg on 71st near the McDonalds. I heard either 3 or 4 shots. Be careful out there, everyone!"
UpperWestSide,1.0,"Has anyone heard this guy the last couple of weeks? Clearly drunk, but a few times now, at like 3AM, has been screaming and crying as loud as he can for over an hour each time.

The first time there was some sort of fight between him and others because for half an hour he was screaming ‚ÄúGive me my phone back!!!!‚Äù

Last night it was that he hated someone apparently.

RIP getting any sleep.

UpperWestSide,0.65,Anyone know what they‚Äôre building with the really consistent load of semi trucks headed south on Columbus? Crates say Modlogiq which appears to be some sort of modular construction- making me think it‚Äôs just for a short term event. Looks like too much stuff to just be for the Marathon
UpperWestSide,0.92,"For the last three days, in the evening, a convoy of huge trucks surrounded by oversized load cars driving erratically have been barreling down Columbus beeping and engine breaking. It‚Äôs sooooooo loud and I don‚Äôt understand why it would happen 3 days in a row‚Ä¶

Anyone have an idea what that is? Is it marathon related? "
UpperWestSide,0.67,"The trucks are lit up like billboards, but they seemed covered in white, towing white boxes. What are they?"
UpperWestSide,0.69,"Is there any plan to open a new spot across the street (north) from McDonalds? For the past 3 years it‚Äôs just been a place for teens to roll dice and smoke weed, homeless people to openly shoot up and for people to pee. It‚Äôs really such a trashy corner. The scaffolding has been there for years and no work is being done.  People with strollers are squeezing through throngs of teens literally rolling dice and gambling on the sidewalk while smoking weed. Does anyone know what the plan is there?  "
UpperWestSide,1.0,"Hi! I haven‚Äôt ever had this issue before so I haven‚Äôt even thought about it, but I‚Äôm looking for a good cobbler on the UWS to help repair my brand new pair of red leather flats.

UpperWestSide,0.94,I recently moved to the area and would love to hear people's favorite coffee shops in the neighborhood and why. I love supporting independent coffee shops and find that it's a great place to meet people.

UpperWestSide,0.87,"There are marathon fireworks this Friday in Central Park (Cherry Hill) around 6:20 PM. 

I actually live in Astoria, but the fireworks were extremely loud by our apartment last year, probably because of proximity to the water. 

I have a relative who lives on the upper West side that I am thinking about leaving my dog with during the fireworks, because I don‚Äôt want her to be alone as she is terrified. 

My relative does not remember ever hearing the marathon fireworks loudly in their apartment, even though technically, they are much closer than me. This is in the vicinity of Broadway and West End, in the 70s. 

Does anyone remember how loud the fireworks are on the upper west side, but west of the park, and can you hear them loudly in your Apt if you‚Äôre in the general area? 

I am trying to figure out what to do with my dog. I don‚Äôt have a lot of options on short notice and we have tickets to an event so we will not be home. Even getting someone to come to my home, she will be scared here. Trying to figure out what to do. Thanks for any help. I realize this might be an annoyingly specific question just trying to get some info. "
UpperWestSide,0.92,Always see a couple of officers and a police car parked. 
UpperWestSide,0.92,Around 2pm today I saw 10 police cars pull a Citi bus over and scream for everyone to get off. 71st and Columbus outside the bodega. I left quickly fearing it was a dangerous scene. Anyone have any context? 
UpperWestSide,1.0,"OP is a laze who managed to go two seasons without finally cleaning my old mainstay winter coat (full length wool). It's a nice, sturdy coat that I can't afford for someone to ruin. Has anyone found a dry cleaner that they genuinely trust? Hopefully not somewhere that shoves items into the back of a truck and then half-asses them through a cheap machine in some sweatshop? Sorry if this sounds snobbish, but I'm tired of paying to get things back that look (and smell) exactly the same. Thanks in advance."

UpperWestSide,0.95,"I was shocked to see this on the news as it hasn't blown up anywhere.  There was an attempted rape of a woman at around 5:10 AM on Saturday morning in Central Park near Lasker Rink (i know it's not the upper west side, but very close proximity, especially for those who frequent the park).

There was no machine to put in a tip and I didn‚Äôt have to sign a receipt or anything so they must‚Äôve added this themselves after the fact. 

I was alerted by my credit card of the outrageous tip otherwise probably wouldn‚Äôt have caught it. 

Just a heads up. "

UpperWestSide,0.92,"On October 18th, 2024, at 1 pm, I was sitting on the corner of a field in the Upper West Side with my dog. A woman sat across from me and suddenly asked, ‚ÄòWhy are you sitting like that? Do you need to use the restroom?‚Äô I have no idea why someone would ask a complete stranger that, so I fully ignored her. She asked two more times, and I still didn‚Äôt respond or even look at her. Then, she came up to me and started talking to my dog, saying, ‚ÄòYeah, she‚Äôs lazy,‚Äô referring to the fact that I was sitting on the grass. I asked her to leave us alone, and she eventually turned back to her side. I had no idea she would come back, but she did‚Äîand this time, she grabbed her coffee, which I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, and spilled it on me.

I did file a police report, and they classified it as harassment, but they won‚Äôt investigate further since I don‚Äôt have her details (she isn‚Äôt my neighbor or anything).

With that being said, have you seen this woman? If you have any information about her or where to find her, please let me know"

UpperWestSide,0.73,"Hi everyone, I just moved to UWS (the 60s) in late September. I have developed social anxiety in 2023, which I have worked on heavily this spring/summer, but now I feel like all my progress have vanished and I am back to square one in a new, unfamiliar home-base. I have developed some agoraphobia and have not left my apartment in 6 days. I used to walk/run/bike 12,000+ steps daily (like literally only 3 weeks ago lol).

Lincoln Square is lovely and living next to Central Park is a blessing. My apartment is incredible. I have no regrets moving here, but moving to a new neighborhood is extremely overwhelming and I want to ask for some advice:

1. Where can I walk/stroll mindlessly where there is little people? Before moving here, I thought Central Park was going to be my place, my own personal backyard to walk everyday... but there are so. Many. People. Ironically, I used to live in Lower East Side (near Ludlow/Orchard Street) so I know it's not really the amount of people/crowds that triggers my anxiety. I was able to to carve out a path where very few people walk, mostly near the waterfront/Williamsburg Bridge. 
2. Living in a doorman-building is giving me so much anxiety. I know they don't care and it's just a job, but I used to live on the first floor of a pre-war walk-up and I love just popping down for a quick cigarette smoke or a walk to the deli without anyone tracking my movement. Now, I don't even call Uber Eats anymore because I don't want to deal with the front desk or whatever they call themselves. Previously, I just buzzed the deliveries in via the intercom and they drop it off at my door. Also, I feel like now I have to 'dress up' when I head out. I feel like nobody gave a fuck about their appearance in LES but here everyone seems much more formal, especially near the Columbis Circle. 
3. Any suggestions of where I can do yoga, and any pullup bars? I used to go to John V. Lindsay East River Track and stretch in the grassy middle and it was incredible; my favourite place in the last 2 years. I'm disappointed they're closing down Sheep Meadow in the winter, so anywhere within 10 blocks of the 60s?

Thank you! I look forward to getting over this fear of a new place, any suggestions will be welcomed. I hope to use logic to better manage my anxiety, and go through exposure therapy! Be real with me, and speak the truth. I need to go back to my daily routine of going outside but not knowing what's around me is really kicking my nerves in"

Hi everyone, I'm getting a group of people together who are interested in reading Jane Marcet's ""Conversations on Chemistry"" (1806).

Jane Marcet ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane\_Marcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Marcet)) was a famous science writer and salon hostess who wrote pop science books geared towards young women. They're written in the form of Socratic dialogue (a teacher having conversations with two female pupils) and are extremely fun to read.

WHAT

Plan for the first meeting is to come having read Conversation 1: On the General Principles of Chemistry (pgs. 1-25). Book here via Project Gutenberg:¬†[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26908/26908-h/26908-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26908/26908-h/26908-h.htm)

WHERE/WHEN

We'll meet up at Caf√© Bilboquet ([https://maps.app.goo.gl/AbYw1HxEZLFGRPsW7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AbYw1HxEZLFGRPsW7)) at 12pm on 10/26. DM me so I can let you know in case this time changes.

Harlem,0.89,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share my perspective on living in East Harlem for the past year or so. I feel like there isn‚Äôt as much East Harlem neighborhood representation on the internet, and the representation that there is seems pretty negative. I wanted to share my perspective for someone who chose to live here and is thrilled to do so. 

For context, I‚Äôm a native New Yorker, gay, and POC who moved back after a few years working in another state and purchased an apartment in East Harlem. 

Can I tell you something - a year later and I‚Äôm still excited to be in this neighborhood! It feels like I used a cheat code to able to live in Manhattan.

I have so much to say so I‚Äôll try and organize my thoughts and start with this: 
The thought process around choosing this neighborhood to purchase in for my return was - okay, I would need to be able to travel both downtown and uptown for work a few times a month (I work in health care) and felt like Manhattan over Brooklyn neighborhoods with name recognition would allow me significantly more options. 

Now Let‚Äôs talk: 

Real Estate: 
-Of course, there are great homes all over the city, but what made EH stand out was the sheer size of the apartments at the price point. My goal was to get as much as I could for under a million (respect to all and not trying to sound crass by bringing up numbers) I was spoiled by out of state living where space and amenities are a dime a dozen but can be hard to find in NYC. I did not compromise on a single thing I wanted - over 1200 square feet, two beds and two baths, washer dryer, outdoor space, and multiple southern and northern exposures in a great boutique building. HOA less than a thousand on a gorgeous, tree lined block. 

When I check all of the filters for everything mentioned above on Zillow or RedFin or street easy, there are so many specifically in this neighborhood. 

Transportation: 
So East Harlem is primarily served by the 456 trains, specifically the 6 train. I‚Äôm on 116th street and the stop is perhaps a 7 min walk from my house. Not too shabby in the grand scheme of things. 

If I need to get downtown quickly, I realized I could take the 6 train uptown to 125th and take the express from there. I know 125th has a bad rap but really, as a new Yorker are you really getting in as much trouble out there as the internet says you will end up in? Of course not. 125 is turning into a beautiful thoroughfare with tons of glamorous apartments and shopping.  

Also, what a gift to have the select bus M15 on second avenue. If I have to travel downtown, those are the two main modes of transport I‚Äôd use. With the M15 (select or not) it‚Äôs either a 4 or 6 minute bus ride to the UES (4 min to 96th, 6 min to 86th). 

m60 to LGA is 15 minutes from 125th street. 

And then‚Ä¶I discovered taking the M15 to the Q train on 96th street. After a 4 min bus ride I suddenly have rapid access to the UES, 20 min to time square, 30 min to Penn station, Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, Chinatown, and Brooklyn?! I really feel like I hit the jackpot. 

Also, they started breaking ground on the new Q train extension, which will have stops at 106, 116 and 125th. It‚Äôll take a while, I‚Äôm sure, but I‚Äôm hopeful and already able to get around pretty nicely. 

Dog stuff: 
There‚Äôs a great dog clinic called ‚ÄòOliver‚Äôs Dog and Cat clinic on 115th. We adore the vet. Also, the park on 114th has a dog run and a grassy area for your little guy to run around in. Also so many great, affordable (read: non Manhattan priced) groomers in the area. 

East River esplanade: 
From the park mentioned above, you can walk over the FDR to get to the East river esplanade. Not only are they redoing the EH river walk in 2025 but it‚Äôs great as is to bike down the East side of Manhattan, across the water to Randall‚Äôs island and beyond. 

Food: 
Big Mexican presence, which is delicious and fascinating. There‚Äôs a smattering of old generation Italian spots, soul food, Indian and tons of bakeries. The iconic patsys,  contento, amor Cubano. A speakeasy just opened on 116th called the terrace which is super underground glam. If you need more, take that 4 min M15 to the UES for glamorous restaurants or groceries. The UES becomes your extension neighborhood. 

This might need an addendum post at some point but I wanted to just mention safety. People are uncomfortable with project buildings. But you know who lives in project buildings? Just regular people living lives like in any other building. It‚Äôs literally fine. I‚Äôve never had a problem or seen anything but I‚Äôm sure if you carried yourself well you‚Äôd decrease the odds of anything bad happening. There‚Äôs a lot of older families who are sweet and kind and now a lot of young professionals are joining the fun up here. All the neighborhood natives are so kind and are helpful and supportive. Very old New York. 

Did I mention the Costco, Aldi, Whole Foods, Trader Joe‚Äôs at both 125th and the UES? Or if you‚Äôre in a rush, 4 mins away by bus on the UES. 

Don‚Äôt forget great coffee shops like Don Alejo, Cafe Azalea, el Barrista,Aroma, Dell Aria‚Ä¶.

Is bud your thing? How about queer WOC owned Betty Budz? How about a bud cafe called lambs wool? Need more glam? Take that m15 down‚Ä¶

Anyways, just wanted to spread some positivity. I feel so fortunate to live here. And am thankful for everything I‚Äôve discovered and learned about the area. Things work out the way they are supposed to, you know? 

Just appreciate your hood even if the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt see its value‚Ä¶yet. "

Harlem,0.77,"I was standing out on my fire escape having a smoke after a stressful day. It was around 1:35am (24th Oct 2024) and I heard 5 LOUD booms. I was on call with my friend and she freaked out and that‚Äôs when I realised what was happening. It was atleast 5 back to back gunshots, and I could hear it come from right beside the building on 124th and Malcom X. I also heard a woman yell on top of her lungs.

I called 911 immediately and told them, they said police will be there. The sirens came in a couple of seconds. I went down to see how chaotic things were. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought, people were immediately moving about, going on with their day. 

I just found out it was a 16 y/o who got shot and I find it so fucked that they weren‚Äôt even an adult?? 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of shit go down over the last two years at Harlem Shake. Every time I‚Äôm around there, there‚Äôs ALWAYS someone screaming, yelling, even hitting each other. Moreover, the other side of the road also has so much crap going on all night. I figured it‚Äôs mostly because of the big lights outside the ATM, and the subway station attracting people but it‚Äôs kind of sad that there‚Äôs nothing being done. 

I see a lot of people working late hours and early mornings; taking the buses and subways, what‚Äôs to say a crackhead isn‚Äôt gonna throw a trashcan on my head tomorrow? 

I‚Äôve stayed here for two years now and I‚Äôve always kept a positive attitude about it, but lately it‚Äôs getting harder for me to justify this. "

Afterwards I went on a downwards spiral that spanned many years and quit music which was the thing I loved most in this life.  To make matters worse, I‚Äôve since learned that he preyed on multiple under aged women in the dance community in Harlem.

He went to jail for years for raping a woman while on tour with Eve, he took advantage of the young women he ‚Äúmentored‚Äù and he was subsequently murdered by the man whose wife he was sleeping with, despite having his young children and wife at home.

I‚Äôm tired of every year seeing the media and community commemorate his legacy when I know how much pain he has inflicted upon the youth that he swore to mentor and protect. 

I‚Äôve reached out to the organizers of the memorial event and held round tables with people I thought I could trust to, at minimum, use their platform to highlight the world of dance as opposed to a predator.  Yet, I just got a notification last week that ‚ÄúSmiley Day‚Äù has once again gone off without a hitch.   

Any victims of Smiley or those who are advocates for sexual abuse victims, I welcome and appreciate any help or advice you can offer to right this injustice.  Smiley Day or any event praising Smiley for his contribution to Harlem dance is a slap in the face to all young women who he assaulted. It‚Äôs time for our young women, especially those from Harlem, to know that they are safe, loved, and heard! "

Immediately just say to him are you mentally ill just because he said he is going thru alot ??( He was already informed of his surgery and so forth so he knew he did not have any mental issues)   Why ?

He candidly said. Yes. I asked if he had mental problems? I asked why?? He replied , because he said he was going thru alot. I then responded is that a reason to automatically assume he has mental issues. He then said . I opologize.............. After the humiliation and smirks and laughter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Harlem,0.63,"I will be travelling to New York in October, for the first time, alone. I am quite used to solo travelling, and have so far been pretty good at doing that through Asia and Europe. However, New York makes me a bit nervous and am trying to do my research. I would love to visit the neighborhoods rich in culture, as I have a deep admiration for the artistic expressions that came from places like Brooklyn, Bronx, Harlem and more. This takes me to my next question.
There is a stand-up show (Aries Spears) at the Apollo, which happens to be on my birthday. I would love that to be my birthday gift (perfect venue &amp; one of my fav comedians) but I am not sure if it is a comfortable thing to do - going to a standup show, alone, a young woman, in a community I will very likely stand out from (with all my respect). Maybe I am assuming and my question is not justified, to which I am also open, but I would like your advice. What would you recommend me to do? Is a person like me something people are used to seeing at stand-up shows in Harlem? Has anyone been in a similar situation?
Any suggestions or advice is welcome. I appreciate your time and thank you for your answers!

We will dive into the art history of the Mail Art movement (from Ray Johnson to Miranda July). We will sign our names to the official address book, reviving the anti-establishment art movement that went viral before social media.

EastVillage,0.63,"Traveler from up north visiting nyc for the first time. Have been here a few days and have encountered zero issues regarding payment or tipping at restaurants.
Visited Sobaya at 229 E 9th St for an early dinner. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt full; perhaps around five other tables when we entered. The usual ordering and food was all typical. Service was definitely below average with the employees ignoring us for water refills and there was an observable stark contrast in service. For example, the employee provided a very thorough explanation of drink options to the table next to us. While when speaking to my table, they had a short attitude as if they would rather be anywhere but there.
When we received the bill, we noticed an item was not on it and even mentioned it to the waitress before paying.
The problem arises after payment of bill and cash tip. A different waitress (not the same as the one that billed us) chased after us and stated that we did not tip enough. However, we have left a more than suitable and acceptable amount despite the horrible service provided. She spoke to us in an extremely derogatory manner as if I was dumb and did not understand tipping (note: tipping exists in Canada too). However in the heat of the moment, we handed over a couple more bills. During this interaction, she lectured us about how there was a law about how we had to tip them a certain percentage but none of us have ever heard of it. Despite our thorough research before visiting, we have not seen a single mention of this but became a bit unsure of whether there was such a thing. However she insisted that there was this tipping rule and even told us to google it if we wanted to in a very demanding and nasty tone. Even after we handed over the amount she wanted, she kept going on how this is how waiters survive here in a woe is me type of tone. 
Afterwards, we did extensive googling and have been unable to find anything about this ‚Äúrule‚Äù and I personally feel very uncomfortable with this entire experience which is why I decided to share this in hopes that no one else received this kind of experience. I also came up with two potential reasons as to why this happened. 1) my table spoke some Mandarin from time to time 2) we were tourists
If anyone does visit, I‚Äôd hope you have a lot of extra money to spend and enjoy bad service that you paid for. If you truly want to try it, avoid the waiter with shoulder-length hair who speaks with a Thai or Indonesian accent."

Greenpoint,0.75,"Hi all! 

I‚Äôm a journalist that reports on all things Greenpoint/Williamsburg. The well known group TAO Hospitality proposed earlier this year that they want to open a nightclub in Greenpoint that would be open until 4am in a large empty space near Inlet Park. 

If you know about this or have any opinions/concerns surrounding the topic please reach out to me via email at andrianakbusiness@gmail.com or through Instagram @andrianakourkoumelis! I would love to get the communities perspective on this! 

An article is attached for context. "

Greenpoint,0.54,"Here's one. So I've been out of state for the last few months, and yesterday I went to get a haircut at the same place I've been going to for like ten years...and it wasn't there! It was at 689 Manhattan Ave right next to the Manhattan 3 Decker. Years ago the same two barbers were across the street. It's something called ""Noble Lash Foot Spa"" now. Anyway, anyone got good  recommendations for adult men's haircuts in the area? Or, better yet, if you know if Geraldine and Maria moved somewhere else? They were great. Thanks!"

Greenpoint,0.94,"Called 911 tonight on two men molesting a clearly drunk woman that was passed out on a picnic table along with someone spooning her that they were also attempting to rob. after about 15 min and the police not showing up, I went to the polling station at the pool and got the attention of the officer there. He looked it up and said 911 never reported it to the precinct. He left his station to go deal with it thankfully.

I will also add that I tried calling 911 several times at the 10 min mark because it shouldn't have taken them that long to go 3 blocks. Each time I was instantly forwarded to a recorded message and then followed by what I can only describe as dial up sound, but even more annoying.  Did I get blocked by 911?! Haha

Edit: this was at McCarren Park, across the street from Bernie's where the kid's park is/at the grills. Thought I included that detail. "

She was walking her dog and this guy suddenly had her by the neck.  He's also apparently been going into the CB Deli grocery trying to start fights, the owner had to try to get him out with a baseball bat but then this dude grabbed the bat so now he has a baseball bat.

Cops were called and apparently did very little except take a statement from the woman.

Greenpoint,0.36,Anyone know if Pinx on Manhattan Ave and Frost St is permanently closed? This was an illegal weed store that got shuttered and then became Pinx which was a front for an illegal weed operation.

Greenpoint,0.9,"I‚Äôm so curious what this building on Borden Ave is going to be. It‚Äôs technically not GP, but across the Newtown Creek in LIC.

At first I thought it was a movie theatre with a parking lot. If you zoom in on the photos, you can see that the ‚Äúparking lot‚Äù has HVAC installed - so it must be something else. 

There also appear to be truck loading docks built in, which means it might be a big box store or a grocery store?"

I'm at the point in my life where I finally want to settle down and have kids. I chose this neighborhood because a friend of mine recommended it's a great place to meet like-minded women who share my same subtle sensibility. I make 600k a year before bonus as creative director for a defense contractor. At this point, I'm just looking for a single woman in her late 30s who maybe just got out of a bad relationship with a non-committal man child and is finally ready to settle down with an older man who knows what he wants. 

What i'm looking for: 

1. Stylish woman, late 30s, no kids, tattoos
2. Frequents natural wine bars
3. Has a dog that you like to take to the wine bars
4. Has a unique friend group of interesting people that eat charcuterie and drink orange wine. 
5. Likes to go upstate on the weekend and has friends that moved up there during covid so you have access to a cute cottage. 
6. Has rich parents with a nice house in a different state. 
7. Wants to dress me up like a ""cool guy"" and parade me around at brunch. 

DM me if interested!

Greenpoint,0.9,"A family of 5 tabbies were trapped from a backyard on Leonard St. and were spayed, neutered and vaccinated. Some of them are semi friendly which indicates they might have a regular feeder, but haven‚Äôt been able to find any information.

Due to lack of resources, the best thing we can offer them is releasing them back to where they came from but the landlord of the exact yard they were trapped isn‚Äôt allowing a shelter and food station to be set up there. So we are looking for someone on that street to set up a winter cat shelter in their backyard and continue feeding them. We will provide the shelter and help with the food.

Since they are all fixed, they won‚Äôt be reproducing, spraying, or doing other annoying things that unfixed cats do, and will more likely keep other unfixed cats from coming over the backyard.

My dog is only 10 lbs and scared of big dogs (she‚Äôs generally fine with dogs under 25/30 lbs). There are no off leash hours at McCarren so the dog run is the only place she can run around outside. Increasingly, people are bringing big dogs into the smaller dog run. I actually just walked by and there were 3 dogs that looked between 50-75 lbs and one chihuahua. 

Obviously I take full responsibility for my dog‚Äôs safety. When a big dog enters, we leave immediately. 

My question is, am I even right to be annoyed? Is the smaller dog run actually supposed to be for small dogs? 

Other small dog owners, what do you do in this situation? 

And large dog owners who take their dogs to the smaller dog run, why?"

Greenpoint,1.0,"Hi neighbors! On Sunday 9/15 I was among a small group of people who had stopped out of concern for a little baby squirrel who had seemingly fallen from its nest in McGolrick Park late morning. After chatting with a friend with a longtime background in animal rescue to make sure I was doing the right thing for the squirrel, I ended up taking the baby home to grab a carrier and a towel, and took him to Wild Bird Fund on the UWS.

I just wanted to post an update here in case any of the folks who stopped by the little guy have been wondering what ended up happening after I scooped him up, and to reassure anyone who was maybe concerned that he was separated from his mama that bringing him to a rescue team was indeed the right move (I know that sometimes this isn‚Äôt the right thing to do!).

Attached is an update from WBF on his status, as well as a screenshot from the sweetest video of the cutie from his brief minute in my apartment (which has since been thoroughly disinfected and inspected!). He was not fearful at all, and used his little ‚Äúhands‚Äù and mouth to arrange his blankets exactly how he wanted them for the car ride, and then slept the whole way :). 

Anyway, he was so effing cute and sweet, and is doing better! Thanks to everyone who stopped‚Äîyou are my people!

Greenpoint,0.71,Does anybody know a good spot in Greenpoint or Williamsburg to buy firewood? I know grocery stores and bodegas will typically sell it but I'm looking to buy in bulk. 
Greenpoint,0.98,"I was approached by what seemed like very sincere college students, and I feel so dumb for falling for this. They said, ""Can you please sign this petition about the environment so we can go home!""

Then they explained that thanks to a new NYC bill, you can ask ConED to use renewable energy instead of non-renewable energy for your account. And that nothing will change, including the cost of your electricity: the only thing that changes is that ConEd is now required, upon request, to use renewable energy for your electricity.

I was glad to sign up, and gave them my account number so that they could send the request to ConEd.

But I've come to learn that they actually switched my electricity provider to Green Mountain Energy (basically a third-party electricity supplier that still bills you through ConEd), which is a well known scam. Reading about it on Reddit, they charge almost twice as much for electricity, and the environmental difference is negligible.

I was able to call ConED to cancel the plan before it started (they said I had to call Green Mountain first, but I couldn't get in touch with them). I'm glad I caught this in time, because if I tried to cancel once the plan kicked in, Green Mountain charges a $150 to $295 cancellation fee.

Just don't want others making the same mistake I did!"

Greenpoint,0.97,"Hey everyone. Like many folks out there, my building is ruled by a terrible landlord that tries to take advantage of us and break laws. Our neighbors upstairs, who live in a rent stabilized apartment, are from Poland and speak very little English. The landlord is trying to increase their rent by several hundred dollars, which in this case is violating rent stabilization laws. They are panicking and don‚Äôt understand their basic rights. They don‚Äôt even know about 311.

Everyone in our building has tried to help them understand how to get help, but the language barrier is making it impossible. Would anyone be able to help us translate into Polish instructions on how to get help? Also, leads any Polish speaking lawyers, regardless if they practice housing law or not, would be very appreciated. Thank you! "

Bushwick,0.5,"I moved to a new apartment in September in Brooklyn. Obviously because it‚Äôs New York, it‚Äôs kinda pricey. I thought it would be worth it considering I have a washer and drier and the place is super nice. When I moved in, the place wasn‚Äôt exactly ready for someone to live in it. For the first two weeks of my first month the electricity wasn‚Äôt even on. They told me it was an issue with the electric company and to ask them to help. Turns out they labeled my braker wrong üòí. Adding on, my refrigerator was filled with flies and maggots and I had to completely disinfect it. My tub and sink don‚Äôt drain, and lastly and most annoyingly, my washer was filled with nasty standing water and mold. Not to mention the dryer doesn‚Äôt work. I disinfected the washer to the best of my ability but I have acquired some type of skin infection and I assume it‚Äôs from that (sorry TMI). I have reached out to the company several times and they keep saying they will put a maintenance ticket in for me, but no one comes. Now they don‚Äôt even respond. Is it appropriate to request a deduction on my rent? Should I go to the city and report them? I‚Äôm really upset, as I work really hard to afford a nice place, and it turned out like this. "

Bushwick,0.82,"hey y'all. so i found out about this cafe cilantro club from this reddit page a few months ago. wild business model, runs on a subscription so you pay a $9 flat fee and get the food and stuff at cost. and at the start of the summer the food and coffee were great, friendly and quick service, simple healthy food. sounded like a pretty cool idea, but I figured it was too good to be true and so did a lot of other people in the thread. well, I'm afraid me and the other skeptics might have been right. 

recently the energy has been different there, right? I'm pretty sure the one blonde barista quit (good for her, she was nice but she looked like she was constantly overwhelmed) and from what i can tell they haven't hired anyone new. and they were already understaffed! since then, it's honestly been pretty abysmal. coffee is still alright (the other baristas aren't as friendly but they're good), but the food has gotten so much worse. seems like its been getting worse for a while (switching the sandwich bread, inconsistent and unpredictable menu) but they took my favorite item off the menu (ham and cheese croissant), at first serving them grossly cold, and then replacing them completely with some cheap pre-made thing. all the other sandwiches taste like gas station fare. I see the owner back there making them now (because they're understaffed) and he obviously has no food service experience. never wears a hat or gloves. and he's constantly arguing with his staff and customers. makes the vibe in there terrible. and he's bad at pitching his business to new customers so when a new customer is there when you're waiting for your pickup order it makes the whole process take longer. especially when they don't get the business model and you can see him getting frustrated trying to explain it. which is a super fun vibe when you're just like...... standing to the side waiting for your latte. plus, they raised the prices, changed to pickup only, and started taking more and more stuff off the menu. 

anyway I feel like this place has got to be closing soon. when I've talked to the owner before he seemed nice enough, but kinda clueless. he said they opened in February and to be honest I can't see them resigning the lease there. it seems like he's scrambling to make it work and its just making the business worse. and no replacement for the barista who quit means he's running out of money. sorry to say, but I think cilantro club is cooked. hopefully it survives the winter, but I doubt it'll last past January. I already unsubscribed just because the food and vibe has been so bad, but if you're still into it I say get it while you can. the summer of cilantro is over. it's like moviepass all over again üò≠üò≠üò≠"

Bushwick,0.33,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm on the hunt for a talented designer to bring a custom desk vision to life. I‚Äôm looking for a setup that not only functions as my day job workspace but also doubles as extra storage in my bedroom.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of what I‚Äôm hoping for:

* **Corner Design**: I‚Äôd love the desk to wrap around a corner, maximizing space without making the room feel cramped. It needs to allow for comfortable walking space.
* **Shelves and Drawers**: Built-in shelves and drawers are a must for storage and organization.
* **TV Mount Space**: I‚Äôd like a spot for a TV to be hung on the wall above, ideally integrated into the design so it feels cohesive.
* **Style &amp; Practicality**: The design should be functional for work but not overly ‚Äúoffice-like‚Äù since it‚Äôs going in my bedroom.

If anyone has experience with designing custom furniture, especially space-saving solutions for bedrooms, please reach out! Looking forward to seeing some creative ideas and making this dream desk a reality. Thanks in advance!"

kromacult is seeking: (1) a drummer, (2) a bassist, (3) a lead guitarist, (4) a producer/synth extraordinaire. The ability to harmonize is ideal.  
  
Until now, I have done all of the above. Some exciting progress is being made and I have reached a point where I would like to socialize the fun.  
  
It is my hope to make something truly collaborative. If we come together and enjoy each others' company, artistry, and vision, I would consider you as much a part of the creative process as I am. For the debut, this means collaborating on the existing ideas/arrangements and extrapolating/developing them together for release. For future releases, this means generating and collaborating on original ideas together.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks!"

Bushwick,0.84,"Ok, so I‚Äôve seen plenty of posts in this community about the increase in assaults, rats, and public drug use, but is it just me, or has it gotten much worse over the past month or two?

I live a few blocks down from the Dekalb station, near Irving, and every day on my way to and from the station, I see used needles and people openly using drugs‚Äîeven at 8 a.m. Just yesterday, I had to confront someone to leave my stoop as they were preparing to shoot up heroine and the same thing happened last week. Last month, I was even swung at, completely unprovoked, by another person on drugs.

My question is‚Ä¶ has it always been this bad? I honestly feel unsettled at all hours, day and night. Is there anything we can do as neighbors to address this issue together?

- Studying for a degree nutrition and public policy 
- Trying to start a community garden or restaurant

Bushwick,0.96,"I found this very sweet, very small cat on the street this morning and I need to find a foster for her ASAP. I can pay for all food and medical bills until she gets adopted. She's desperate for love and I can't give her enough attention because I have to keep her separate from my other cats so I'm looking for someone without any other pets who wants a sweet creature attached to you like a magnet. She hasn't seen a vet yet but she seems in good health and I will be bringing her on Monday.

Bushwick,0.67,"Me and my roommates (3 of us total) moved out of my previous apartment Sep 30th and we did have a final walkthrough and they said they would be taking out $1500 for ""paint damage"" when in actuality there were maybe 5 holes and some paint did not match (this was like this before we moved in and the painters who came after we moved in didn't match the paint either so not our fault but hard to dispute). We waited 14 days for our security deposit to be returned, management asked for address for checks to be mailed and also sent our walk through report. However when we tried inquiring about when the check would be sent was only given a vague answer.

We waited 14 days and did not receive anything, I went to housing court on the 15 and filed a small claims appeal and have my court date set for April, I had to go through this with a previous apartment so was very familiar with my rights and the whole process, something I shared with this management as well to emphasize how serious I was about following up..

Today, the 25 we finally get 3 separate checks in the mail and they're dated the 17 so after the 14 day period. The amount on the check is reflective of the dedication of $1500 for the paint damages. One of my roommates, his name is spelled wrong on the check. My question is, if we were to still pursue the small claims case to get the rest of the money back, should we wait to cash the checks? Based on my research and knowledge, we should be entitled to the full amount no matter if there were damages or not since they did not return the money in the proper amount of time.

As it currently stands, each of us roommates are walking away with about 2/3 of the deposit we individually put down before we moved in, to me I am fully willing to wait it out and fight to get all of my money back because I don't like being taken advantage of and it is my hard earned money. I think my other roommates are kind of on the fence which I understand, so in this situation I guess there's multiple options/scenarios to consider. But first, would it be wrong to go ahead and cash the checks now so we can have some money back now but still go ahead with the court case to get the remainder back. Or do we need to wait until we have the court case to touch the money.

In my old apartment I had to wait 9 months to have my court date and we ended up settling in mediation and while it was a huge nuisance and my landlord was incredibly stubborn despite being in the wrong, we finally did get our money back which was a huge win and relief. However in that apartment, there was never any final walk through or damages report so in this current situation, I just wasn't sure how optimistic I should be about my chances of getting the ""paint"" charges thrown out since there is in writing a report but also they didn't send the money in the 14 day period."

Williamsburg,0.35,"Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt really know what to do here, but I know that I really want to do as much as possible to ensure fewer people ever have to bite into plastic cooked into food from the supermarket.  A few days ago, I purchased frozen chicken enchiladas from Trader Joe‚Äôs, cooked it in the microwave, ate some if it, and then bit into a hard black piece of plastic the size of half of my fingernail.  Luckily I didn‚Äôt eat it. I was able to spit it out.  I‚Äôm obviously grossed out and disturbed by this but I have no idea what to do to hold Trader Joe‚Äôs and/ or the manufacturer accountable. I have the packaging for the frozen entr√©e, the rest of the frozen entr√©e that I didn‚Äôt eat, the black, hard piece of plastic, and the receipt.  I already called Trader Joe‚Äôs and told them what happened and a very kind manager asked me to bring everything by the store.  He offered me a refund for the enchiladas but that obviously doesn‚Äôt even begin to make up for what happened.  I also left a voicemail for the state department of agriculture and markets to put in a formal complaint.  Any other advice?  Thx fam."

I‚Äôm aware that large amenity buildings are cheaply constructed or more expensive than they are worth and I can live with that. Also aware that at a large building you‚Äôre always going to have some unhappy tenants. There are going to be leaks, broken appliances, etc.

Primarily I am concerned about rats, roaches, bedbugs and mice.

ChelseaNYC,1.0,"I‚Äôm a law student and in my 30s and wasn‚Äôt looking to share an apartment with others as I feel I‚Äôm a bit too old for that, so a studio apartment was a necessity for me, but I only needed one for a few months, and Outposts Union Square House happened to have one extremely close to my school (NYU). The sales process was smooth and easy and the agent went above and beyond to help. I appreciated the transparency throughout the process with upfront costs and it eased my mind to know that, should there be any maintenance issues, their property management team would be on top of it, as I think we‚Äôve all heard horror stories about slum lords that can never be trusted to maintain their properties sufficiently. The space itself is one I‚Äôm proud to live in and show friends and it‚Äôs pretty large for a nyc studio."

I‚Äôm a teacher working in Manhattan, but would love to start picking up some shifts as a waitress to make extra money. I have experience waitressing in the past.

The problem is, I‚Äôm obviously working M-F until 5ish PM and some nights I need to stay at work later. I‚Äôm ideally looking for a place that might need people to pop in and help at times that are flexible. Ideally, I‚Äôd make my own hours work and help out when I can.  

I know this isn‚Äôt the easiest thing to find, so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows any restaurants or bars in Manhattan where this sort of help is wanted or possible?? Long shot but I need money on top of my full time job!

LongIslandCity,0.67,"49 keys with USB port. Barely used this keyboard and like new! Comes with the wall plug to power it.

From Amazon:

POWERFUL CONTROL CENTER: Impact LX49+ features 26 programmable real-time controls: 9x 30mm faders, 9x MIDI buttons and 8x potentiometers. Each control is fully programmable to send unique MIDI messages and can be stored in any of the 5 user presets

PADS FOR BEATS AND GROOVES: The 8 pads are great to play. Dynamic and sensitive, they are ideally suited for finger drumming. Assign sounds or MIDI notes to the pads is quick and easy with Impact's unique Pad Learn feature: Activate, just hit a pad to select, and press a key on the keyboard to assign the MIDI note

NEKTAR DAW INTEGRATION: Nektar DAW Integration takes Impact LX+ way beyond the functionality normally offered by USB MIDI controller keyboards: Give the mouse or trackpad a break and navigate projects, control the mixer or tweak plugins directly from Impact LX+

TRANSPORT AND NAVIGATION: Navigate your projects: The 6 dedicated transport buttons are always within reach and mapped to control Cycle, Rewind, Forward, Stop, Play and Record. Dedicated Track up/down and Patch up/down buttons are located below the display

MIXER CONTROL: Press Mixer and the first 8 Impact LX+ faders are assigned to control 8 DAW mixer channels. The alternate Bank up/down function moves assignments to the next or previous group of 8 channels"

As you may have read in the news, our neighbor Amanda Servedio was killed last week while on her way home from the weekly Bike &amp; Brew ride by a truck fleeing a high speed police chase in Astoria. There is a Vigil and Memorial Ride tomorrow at 6:30 for Amanda. You all are invited to join the community to advocate for change.

Amanda loved the Long Island City waterfront, so the ride will be going through Long Island City.

LongIslandCity,0.77,"To Pooches LIC
I‚Äôm writing this because I am now beyond furious and would like to share the story of how my dog Noodle was neglected care by this facility after an email they sent out to all their ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù. 
My dog has been going to pooches since he was most likely 7/8 months old and is now 3 and a half. 
I booked him a boarding and haircut as usual and was told that the haircut was going to be done at 9am today. 
I get a call at 11am on the dot asking me what kind of haircut I would like my pup to receive. 
Now fast forward to 11:15 am I receive over 7 calls from my front desk people telling me my dog is in the elevator and is shaking scared, peeing himself and looks stressed. 
Pooches doesn‚Äôt call me until 15 minutes later that my dog went missing. 
I‚Äôve obtained footage of my dog free running in front of the building, running into the lobby and into the elevator of the building we live in. 
They then tell me, when they were taking my dog from the ‚Äúbig dog area‚Äù outside instead of lettin him cross though the ‚Äúsmall dog area‚Äù he ‚Äúrolled on the floor and broke free‚Äù 
My dog never rolls on the floor outside and I‚Äôve asked them for footage of their outdoor camera. 
Then they had the nerve to tell me they had 5 people chasing him on bike, when I have multiple eye-witnesses telling me he was running down blocks alone. 
The fact that they‚Äôre now sending me an email to ‚Äúcomp his grooming‚Äù and then SENT ANOTHER EMAIL NOW to their customer base to protect their asses, stating that it was because he was anxious has sent me OFF 
Instead of accepting any blame they seem to be pinning it on my dog stating he was ‚Äúanxious and skittish‚Äù 
I need advice on what to do because to say I‚Äôm beyond disappointed and disgusted in this behavior would be BEYOND ME RIGHT NOW
"
LongIslandCity,0.94,"There‚Äôs plenty of posts about favorite restaurants, but what‚Äôs your pick for best single dish in LIC?

I‚Äôll start - the Arroz Negro at R40. The saffron aioli, crispy fried calamari, and whole prawn make it so good. 

Would love to hear other thoughts!

LongIslandCity,0.89,"Hello LIC!  u/No_Bear8633 and myself made a website recently to list events happening in Astoria and we've found it often extending into LIC...lots of overlap, both LIC folk venturing into Astoria and Astoria residents taking the N/W train down south. We post lists regularly over in the Astoria subreddit and it's stickied on the sidebar. We are thinking of whether to expand it properly to cover LIC? 

If you think it would be valuable, we would need some help with this: 

1) Moderator(s) to help add events and approve event submissions 

2) Spread the word among organizers and venues so they know to post what they've got going on (and less work for moderators to add stuff manually)

Let us know what you think!

Went to Alcove for brunch last weekend, and I am always so in love with that place.

A reminder that this Sunday is the end of DST, so don't forget to change those clocks. And just in case that wasn't enough, it's also the NYC Marathon! Doesn't come quite up here, but great viewing points right after the half as runners start the tough run over the QB Bridge. I'll be out in LIC cheering on the runners. If anyone is running, drop your bib # and I'll make sure to cheer extra loud! (Will also have pretzels and oranges to all who are looking)."
SunnysideQueens,0.78,"This guy walks through my apartment complex at anywhere from 1am-6am loudly ranting about politics (in about as incoherent a way as possible), saying racial slurs, saying things like ""Fuck you all I hope you die"" etc. 

Heard him this morning at about 3am doing this same thing and on his way out of my apartment complex I heard him break something glass. Usually he just walks through while doing this but occasionally he'll just stand there (extremely close to the first floor apartment windows) while loudly ranting about whatever. 

It's disruptive and I'm frequently woken up by this guy because he's very loud but it's also pretty alarming. Dude sounds like a ticking time bomb that fortunately hasn't encountered anyone getting home really late or going to work very early to my knowledge, but I feel like the second he does there's gonna be some incident. 

Reported to my building's management and hopefully they can look at the security footage and at least give some info to the police."

SunnysideQueens,0.84,"I'm curious what people's thoughts are on the city's ballot proposals. Here's a quick chatgpt summary of them.  
  
The 2024 NYC ballot includes six local proposals focusing on updates to the city's laws and administrative operations:

1. **City Civil Rights Protection Expansion**: This proposal would add additional protections against discrimination in the City Charter, explicitly covering sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, and more.
2. **Sanitation and Trash Collection Rules**: A proposal to grant the Department of Sanitation more authority over trash collection, focusing on managing litter and enforcement of cleanliness standards across public and some private spaces.
3. **Financial Cost Estimates for New Laws**: This would require the City Council to provide cost analyses for certain proposed laws to improve transparency on fiscal impacts before passing legislation.
4. **Advance Notice for Public Safety Legislation**: This would mandate advance notice and a public comment period for any proposed legislation impacting public safety policies, giving residents a voice in related decisions.
5. **Capital Plan Transparency and Assessment**: This aims to require more comprehensive, publicly accessible assessments of city infrastructure to inform long-term capital planning and budgeting.
6. **Streamlining Business Support and Film Permits**: Proposals include easier permitting for film projects, measures to support Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs), and restructuring archive review processes for efficiency."

The almond filling was a good mix of salty and sweet and was throughout the croissant, instead of the usual single disappointing strip in the middle. To top it off, it was still warm when I got it. Check it out if you get a chance, I wish they were closer to the subway, but it was worth the detour this morning."

For those who went, what were the restaurants that stood out? üòä"
SunnysideQueens,0.93,"So I will start by saying my spouse is very picky about bakeries, baked goods, and bread as he's French. 

First, tamal.  8/10. I had the pork tamal, and it was very fresh and tasty. I'm not a tamales expert but I found it to be delicious. I don't even like tamales that much. 

Second, viennoisserie.  The croissants in Sunnyside are generally lacking. The closest to a decent one is Paris Baguette but they use an egg wash that my spouse really hates (as a croissant purist).  I have had one at Nita's which was not a croissant at all...the lamination was terrible and so it was like buttery bread with no flaky layers. This croissant (again, according to a man who has eaten a lot of croissants) was a 7/10. Not bad, esp from a non-French operation. The pain au chocolate (or chocolate) was a 9/10!  He was very impressed. 

Lastly, the sourdough. Also a solid 9/10. Smell was great, taste was the perfect amount of tangy. The crumb could be slightly more open but I'm really being nitpicky here. $7 is a better price too than the farmers market. 

We had a sample of some traditional Guatemalan recipes. Those were all also delicious. 

We were skeptical of the baguettes, so did not try those yet but will do so in the future. 

All in all, very solid bakery. Lovely owners, and great addition to the neighborhood. 

Tamal, sourdough loaf, croissant, and pain au chocolate came to $20. Not bad!

I also called Costco on Vernon in Astoria. They accept walkins and have Novavax readily available. 

Can anyone recommend where I can get the Novavax vaccine from a reputable pharmacy? I‚Äôm willing to travel (by bus or subway) to get it, but ideally I‚Äôd like to find it in the neighborhood. I‚Äôm aware I can get the others at Walgreens, etc, but I‚Äôm specifically seeking Novavax.  
Thanks in advance. "

With a barista that takes the craft of making coffee seriously. I don't think it exists here in Sunnyside, but let me know if it does. The closest place I've found to what I'm looking for so far has been Balancero in Astoria, (but even they went downhill a bit with less careful/experienced baristas) which is a decent ways away but not as far as Kinship..."

SunnysideQueens,1.0,"Hello everyone!   
  
Sorry this is coming a little late (bit of a hectic week), but I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to everyone that came by Cool Beans last Thursday for the ""USDA Certified Comedy"" showcase. It entirely slipped my mind to ask people as I was checking them in how they found out/heard about the show, so if you heard about the show through my posting here in the subreddit thank you so much for spending your Thursday evening with us! I hope that you all had fun and enjoyed the comics that performed. 

**We do a monthly showcase every last Thursday of the month**; and we're putting together **our next one which will be on Halloween night**! It's going to be a sort of comedy show/costume party hybrid, so if you're free that night **please come by dressed up** -- we're thinking of doing a sort of costume contest as well and giving away a prize. 

Apart from the showcase, we also do **a weekly variety open mic every Thursday at Cool Beans** - so if you do poetry, short stories, music, anything artistic -- please come by and perform! The mic is free and everybody gets 5 minutes, order is determined raffle style (we pull names out of a hat). **Sign ups open at 7:30PM and we start by 8PM.**

If you have any other questions or just want more info on our showcase or mic, please feel free to DM here or through Instagram at (popshopmic). Or, if comedy isn't your thing and you're just thinking of checking out the cafe -- please do! They're located at **50-20 39th Ave -** and they're the best cafe in the neighborhood. You can also follow them on Instagram at (coolbeanscoffeespot)

Again, thank you so much to anyone and everyone that came by. Doing stuff like this in the neighborhood and getting to meet everyone that comes by to support is amazing."

Flushing,0.77,"Hi everyone, 

My girlfriend just got accepted into Queens College for Spring 2025! Yay for her :) Currently, she is overseas and we are almost definitely choosing this university. We propose to move in the Flushing area, due to easy access to the college and near the 7/LIRR for my office work. However, I have some thoughts/questions. 

Given she is an international student, we will have to rely on my income for the first few months. I am expecting a raise in January 2025, to which should place my base salary at over $70,000 a year. Right now, it is at $65,000 and with overtime throughout this year, will definitely exceed $70,000. 

I want to ask whether this budget of $1,700 a month, due to typical 40x rent rule, is possible to find a studio or a shared apartment arrangement not too far from Main Street, or the buses that lead to Queens College at this range? I have started the search via typical online websites and some studios are around this budget. It seems that most people do not prefer to share a home with a couple, so we are going to try and find our own place. 

Alternately, I have also seen the dadi360 website shared here. We are both non-Chinese. Is it realistic if I can find a slightly cheaper room on there, but with the chance that we can be allowed to rent from there? 

Thanks all for any advice or suggestions! "

These people aren‚Äôt even allowed to have pets on their lease. I‚Äôve contacted the landlord who says he can‚Äôt do much, even after mentioning that they‚Äôre not allowed to have pets. Ive been sending him videos for two weeks straight through email to which he never replies to. I have also contacted 311 and 911, nothing happened.

Flushing,0.86,"During rush hours and every weekend, Roosevelt Av going west can be a standstill. I can see buses bunched up 5-6 deep before hitting Main St terminus like the Q12 and Q15. Then Union St is a nightmare coming from Northern Blvd. Q13,16, and 28 always get stuck trying to turn with traffic into 37th Ave up to 5-10 min just to go *one bus stop.* It is insanity. Weekdays, the family does take the bus but I rather drive in on the weekend because it is even worse.

Admittedly, I am part of the traffic problem but to be fair, we're usually 2-3 passengers in a small EV and I try to avoid Union and Roosevelt like the plague. Forget about Prince St when turning in from Northern Blvd. 

With the new development happening around the area, I can't imagine things getting better without better public infrastructure and transit. Downtown Flushing could use a central transit hub and more bus lanes.

Flushing,0.9,"Hello Flushing community,

We are a group of engineers who have been providing internet services for businesses in Manhattan office buildings since 1999. Now, we‚Äôve come together to form a new ISP right here in Flushing to provide better service tailored to the needs of the community, and to offer service that isn‚Äôt tied to Verizon or Spectrum in any way. 

Our company is brand new, small, and focused on delivering reliable, high-speed internet. We have the funding, the equipment, and we‚Äôre ready to expand off of our dedicated fiber optic network located on Main Street. Every customer will be connected to our network via fiber optic cable and will receive a free WiFi 6E router. 

To start, we are looking to connect our first 100 customers at a great discount. The service will be 1 GIG speed for only $50, which is half of our anticipated price of $100.

We want to hear from you! What should we do to serve you better? We‚Äôre also planning to offer free street-level WiFi on Main Street. If you‚Äôre interested in using our service or want to help us build out our network, please reach out.

We are excited to bring something new to Flushing and to work together with the community to provide the best internet service possible.

Thank you!

1. There was this one hobo I was deathly afraid of when I was a child in the mid and late 90s. He used to wear a trench coat year round, and I want to say his hair was in some type of locks. 

He used to hang right by the front entrance of Key Foods (now HMart) down Roosevelt and by the driveway where Camp Camp is now. I believe he would also occasionally linger around the train overpass down Union street. I did see him once in Bayside by a different train overpass about 10 +/- years ago, but now he was bald. 

What happened to him?

2. This other guy is a lot easier to recognize. He was a Blind Accordion player. He used to perform in front of Caldor (now Macy's). Towards the late 90's early 2000s, I want to say that he made friends with another homeless man. I believe his friend was dirty blonde and was usually seen without a shirt. 

What happened to both of them? 

TLDR; 

What happened to Hobo Trench Coat guy, Blind Accordion player, and his shirtless side-kick?

Flushing,0.86,"Does anyone else see this guy? I see him on the corner of Beech and Kissena every day,  just watching people and cheezin'.  *I've* never heard him say a word, but he seems to have rapport with the older heads on the block. He stands out - you can't miss him, and I think he has the stuff of a Flushing Legend in the making. 

This older gentleman is *tatted up.* Not very tall. Head kinda square-shaped. This man looks like he's lived for real, but he's always smiling, and *always watching.* His tatts give gangsta. 

The back story I've made up for him is that he's a retired enforcer, and every day, he is profoundly grateful to have escaped a violent lifestyle. He found peace in Flushing, appreciates the people of all the different backgrounds, and he's never going back. He looks out for the block, petting tiny dogs and leering at women sometimes. He's got a new lease on life, and now, it's all sunny days ahead.

Another time, they made me see a nurse instead. She misdiagnosed my stomach pain and prescribed me saline water. I had an appendicitis and was in pain for a week longer than I should‚Äôve been because of this. My appendix was completely ruptured.

Lastly, they all seem to have terrible wait times even with appointments. Then they try to get you out as quickly as possible. I feel like half the time, they have no idea what‚Äôs going on and just tell you to go to a hospital.

I was wondering where in the area is the best place for outdoor exercise? The kind that I do requires slightly more room than say pushups and sit-ups, so I added a video to depict the general idea.

I'm actually starting learning things over again so you're welcome to join and learn too, just DM me! 90% of the time I practice, someone comes up to me and before it's said and done, they've learned a move! I don't coach professionally anymore, but I still do less formally. It's easier than you think *after the first week*!

Flushing,0.95,"Terrible service and owner is extremely rude. Ultimately I went with someone else who was more expensive because the customer service was a million times better. Stay away from this place.

Updated to provide clarification and further detail:

I was quoted $2,400 for a 19' x 3' lightbox sign. When I got to their store ready to pay the deposit, I requested to use a credit card. The store owner got annoyed and charged me $2,700. I questioned why is there a 12.5% up charge to use a my Visa card.

He replied ""I told you the price... whats the issue?""

I replied ""I only need clarification on the difference.""

His reply: ""Stop going back and forth. The price is the price.""

Again I replied ""I only need clarification on the difference.""

His reply: ""I don't need to explain.""

So I walked out and found a better place with much better customer service.

After discovering that I gave my honest review, the owner called me, harassed me, threatened physical violence to me and my family. After I refused to pick up the phone, he proceed to text me (as evident in the photos).

Hellskitchen,0.75,"This is definitely a strong cast of chefs, however so far we've had a total of 3 episodes out of 6 where Chefs haven't either quit or try to quit. And judging by the preview for next week, we go back to **ANOTHER** chef trying to quit. 

I know people like to rag on Joy (myself included) for being a loud mouth and then quitting at the very end, however this is just getting ridiculous at this point. 

This season is full of very talented chefs, that's for sure; but it's losing steam so fast due to whenever there's literally any drama the chefs just say ""fuck it, I'll leave."" the fan favorite is usually the underdog who sticks it through and so far that person just doesn't exist. we have some contenders like Brittany and Egpyt, but it seems Egypt's team has been letting up after he threatened to quit and Brittany's team has pretty solid faith in her. 

&gt;!I lowkey wish Ramsey decided to save Amber week 1 , at least then there'd be some drama with her and her team, whereas Megali just coasted for three more episodes and heavily relied on her team to survive. Doubt Amber would've been given as much grace considering she threw one of her teammates under the bus.  !&lt;"
Hellskitchen,0.96,I think it‚Äôs good but not great. I honestly expected more from the Head Chefs Only season but I still enjoy it. 
Hellskitchen,0.78,"This isn't in any sort of order. But I think Ann-Marie, Whit, Amanda, and Lulu will be eliminated just based on past services. 

I believe before the 3rd elimination there will be a switch. The service after the switch no one will be eliminated but after yes people will be eliminated 
"
Hellskitchen,1.0,"I don't have any experience working in a kitchen outside of fast food when I was younger, so I really can't speak from experience on this one.

This question is really strange because, while I haven't watched EVERY SINGLE episode, if you compiled every chef's words, at least one of them has described every single station as ""easiest"". Fish, meats, appetizers, etc. at least one chef said that it was the easiest station.

So like, which is it? Disregarding the various chef's words, it seems like fish or garnish is the most common station for someone to get kicked out of the kitchen."
Hellskitchen,0.9,"Truthfully, even before the episode started, I knew Magali would be out. What‚Äôs even more interesting is that the red team thinks that they‚Äôre in S1 where they can nominate strong chefs so they put up Brittany(ok) and Meghan(meh). I can see some reasons why Meghan deserved to be up there but still. Magali was the main reason why the red team got kicked out after screwing up fish 3 straight times in a row and you would‚Äôve think that hey! Let‚Äôs nominate Magali instead of Meghan since Magali wanted to cook the order herself but no! This ain‚Äôt S1 and Ramsay was not stupid. Thankfully he sent them 2 back in line and he eliminated Magali despite not being nominated(something we haven‚Äôt seen in a few seasons ago). Nice try red team!

Congrats to the blue team for winning another reward challenge and for beating the red team in dinner service for the first time. Shoutout to Egypt for being able to go on his first reward win. Overall a cool episode but with Magali gone now, who could be next?"
Hellskitchen,0.89,How does it sound? Would be funny to see if they somehow get Amy ( I know it's impossible ) to be on the show to cause drama along other delusional chefs/owners. 
Hellskitchen,0.92,"Benjamin literally did the one thing that Ramsay hates, make the proteins wait for garnish, multiple times throughout the night, and Jason wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means, but he was definitely the most vocal in the kitchen outside of Autumn. Imo, he got screwed out of making the F4"
Hellskitchen,0.72,"https://preview.redd.it/m65lfen1o9yd1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd2996f986560997cb0381f85915013aa1ff101

There's something fishy going on"
Hellskitchen,0.97,"She had a complete breakdown and it was just embarrassing to watch. I understand the pressure and getting overwhelmed, but‚Ä¶seriously? Accusing Ramsay of ‚Äúsabotaging‚Äù you?"
Hellskitchen,0.87,"Even though it‚Äôs still way too early in the season to tell and a lot can happen, I honestly think the Top 2 can be Whit vs Anthony.

I‚Äôve never seen either one make a mistake in service and they (almost) always win a point for their team in challenges. (Feel free to correct me here.) 

They‚Äôre both consistent and are also slowly starting to have a spotlight in edits (like most winner edits).

Really curious what everyone else‚Äôs Top 2 are this early in the season."
Hellskitchen,0.89,"I‚Äôm going to bet that Magali‚Äôs time is finally going to come tonight. She‚Äôs been holding on for a while, but I think she‚Äôs probably leaving tonight, unless some miracle happen.

Meghan or Joe will probably be gone next. One of them will be gone next, one of them will probably be the CFYL boot. Joe is starting to decline, and somewhere in the previews IIRC correctly based on the previews, meghan is not going to be in the final 5 in the red team, and Brittany of all people is going to survive over her. So brittany might suddenly crash and burn, get ejected like nilka, leave, or we‚Äôll have yet another med evac.

I‚Äôm sensing a Whit downfall, she made her first mistakes last service, and further down the line, based on previews, she will be kicked out of the kitchen in a future service. I‚Äôm not saying she won‚Äôt win, but I would be on the lookout for her downfall

Hellskitchen,0.96,"Pride ] = a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, or themselves

( Scott s7, Elise s9,17, amber s19, Anton s12, Russell s8 , frank s15, 
Benjamin s7,17 jen s4,18 &amp; zacky wacky s11 ) here's the votes each chef received 
Who ever had the most votes when I woke up was the winner 

1 Scott from season 7 had 15 votes
2 Elise from season 9,17 had 9 votes
3 Anton from season 12 and Russell from season 8 are both tied with 8 votes
4 frank from season 15 and Benjamin from season 7,17 are both tied with 3 votes
5 amber from season 19 had 2 votes
6 jen from season 4,18 and zack from Season 11 are both tied again with 1 vote


In the end while he had a bit of competition but with 15 votes Scott from season 7 takes the crown of pride.

Hellskitchen,0.95,"I never see anyone discuss this guy. I think he's one of the more underrated donkeys in HK, he was pretty funny during his short stay, and he actually holds an interesting record as the youngest competitor in the show's history (up until Young Guns). Overall underrated chef. What do you think?"
Hellskitchen,0.99,One of my favorite parts ü§£
Hellskitchen,0.79,Would it be fun to see a new season where they like redo the all stars of all the chefs where HK winners? Who would you invite back for this season if it would happened?
Hellskitchen,0.31,"By far, she is my all time favorite contestant. Yeah, she might have been 45% attitude, 45% talk and 10% ability, but she made the seasons she was on fun to watch."
Hellskitchen,1.0,"TLDR: I need a way to watch HK live this week since my area has it preempted due to football. (I like participating in the episode threads.)

So, I‚Äôve asked around about this on the last episode thread, but I didn‚Äôt get much of a response. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen this issue either. Someone else mentioned it in a live episode discussion thread, and I knew it was gonna be my turn. Some of you may wonder why HK gets preempted in your area for 1 week or so when a Thursday Night Football game happens. Well, this is due to an NFL rule that requires local markets to broadcast said games. (Out of market just watch directly on Amazon Prime.) 

This week, it‚Äôs my turn to feel the brunt of this due to the Texans Jets game. So if anyone has a way to watch HK live this week, I would really appreciate it. I like participating in the episode threads, and to miss the thread this week would suck. If not well, it is what it is. I‚Äôd like to still be able to watch both live you know."
Hellskitchen,0.89,"Been watching Hell's Kitchen and seen a lot of discussion on the best chefs and winners in HK, but I was curious about chefs who weren't great cooks and placed pretty low but were still likable people."

Hellskitchen,0.63,"Makes me feel like it was a bit staged by the producers, especially because she was eliminated that episode "
Hellskitchen,1.0,"Gordon just sounded so defeated, not sad, just defeated "
Hellskitchen,0.87,"( greed ) update I tallied up all the votes from the tiebreaker post and tavon won with a vote of 4 to Colleens 2 plus I added them all with the 4 votes from the original post that started the tiebreaker and all together tavon wins with 9 votes to Colleens 6 and I'll let this comment from u/harmonicwalrus Speak for himself 

From u/harmonicwalrus and I quote 

My vote for greed is still Tavon. Colleen's school was overpriced for what it was, but to her credit, she offered a real service and took pride in her work. Tavon is just a grifter through and through, dude even changed his name so he could keep scamming people.

( envy ) Some of you guys commented Kiya and some of you guys commented Elise but in the end Kiya wins with a vote of 7 to Elise's 5 ( someone commented Elise when I was sleeping last night )

Hellskitchen,0.92,"Like yeah, she definitely wasn't among the best chefs of S11, and her pre-nomination tantrums were a bit much (except toward Zach, I thought it was cathartic as hell), but otherwise she was my second favourite Red jacket of that season after Mary. Her confessionals were pretty iconic and funny, and her epic confrontation with Gina was something out of Greek mythology. I also appreciate how much of a team player Nedra was for Mary in the final service, despite having initially considered her weak.

Anyone agree?"
Hellskitchen,0.97,"I will admit that I'm pretty new to this show, but my boyfriend (who's seen most seasons) and I are going through every season on Hulu. We watched all of season 22 live and we're keeping up on season 23, but in the meantime we're watching old seasons on Hulu. We're on like season 7 right now but we can't stop joking about the woman in season 2 (I think) who Gordon was yelling at for not having her water boiling, and she said something like ""sorry chef, I heard that cold water boils faster!""

I'm nowhere near the Hell's Kitchen level of cooking and my boyfriend has been a line cook for like 10 years, and we both went ""what?!"" At that, and then Gordon went ""whhhhhaaaaaat?"" In his high pitched ""I can't believe someone is this stupid"" voice...probably my favorite Hell's Kitchen moment I've seen so far."
Hellskitchen,0.81,"Ok so there's a issue I kinda sorta Maybe made a mistake of some sort I went back and did a recount on which chefs represent greed I thought I picked the right one with tavon but turns out someone said Colleen should be up there so I went back and counted all the votes and turns out it's tied at 4 a piece so this is what were gonna do whoever ends up with the most votes by tomorrow when I post day 6 envy will be the winner 
( Ps voting for the since of envy comes down to Kiya from season 20 young guns and Elise from season 9,17)

(Ps number 2 both tavon and Colleen are being chosen because of what they did outside HK 1 they were both cooking teachers [ Colleen was a cooking instructor before she went to HK in season 5 who charges $300 bucks even though she wasn't a certified instructor] [ tavon the 22 year old executive chef turn 1st boot is here because he was offering people cooking classes and he and his staff don't show up. 

Winner will be revealed tomorrow along with the whoever is chosen to be the sin of Envy"

Hellskitchen,0.98,Nikki being nominated in season 19 episode 3 for having less experience than everyone else was pretty dumb. I'm really glad that Syann stood up for her.
Hellskitchen,0.94,"I'm on episode 4 currently and the little argument she had with Elise made me miss Chef Maryann, she wouldve been able to handle Elise

Now today we tackle the sin of greed 

( Greed ) [ A intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, or food.]

This probably the hardest sin we tackled today but the final 2 came down to what they did outside of the show Colleen from season 5 was a cooking teacher who charged $300 even though she wasn't actually a cooking instructor meanwhile tavon the 22 year old executive chef turn 1st boot of season 10 was grifter and a scammer Out here charging people money for some lessons or something and then he dips out the moment he cashes out. and not turning up and not giving refunds¬†and as someone who fell victim to a scam before I gotta say this tavon Maybe known as the Youngest executive chef at 22 turn 1st boot but he will also be known as the Sin the of Greed

Colleen had 4 votes
Tavon 6 votes

Hellskitchen,0.99,"Aside from the obvious ""She only won because I lost"" confessional from Frank S15 and some statements by Zach S11 relating to Japanese food, I would have to go with Jen S3's statement for why she thought it was a good idea to take spaghetti out of the trash.

""212 kills the bacteria... and then I decided to serve it.""

Hellskitchen,0.96,"Found this podcast from Food &amp; Loathing. I originally found this on Instagram, but that was a shortened version, so I searched further and got the full-length version on Apple Podcasts. The part where he talks about his edit starts 41 minutes into the podcast.

Link (requires Apple account): [https://podcasts.apple.com/bb/podcast/ep-27-hells-kitchen-winner-trenton-garvey/id1573608650?i=1000544555258](https://podcasts.apple.com/bb/podcast/ep-27-hells-kitchen-winner-trenton-garvey/id1573608650?i=1000544555258)

Transcript (for those who don't have an Apple account):

*""They \[the show\] definitely made me look like a dick at the end. At the end, I was very focused. I was very determined. I've been working at a kitchen alongside \[Sous\] Chef Christina and \[Sous\] Chef Jason, both very like 'This is how thing are done, let's get it done, push push push', and that's the way I want to do my final service. But, I made a lot of really great relationships and friendships while I was there. I wish it \[the show\] would've explored more of that, more of me being humorous and not so focused. Although I was focused, we had a great time. I mean, from us all hanging out at the hot tub and drinking beers at night to all the relationships. We are all such good friends now. It's weird to have that kind of inseparable bond now that we're all bound by something that very few people get to experience, being part of a season or something, and that was one of the harder parts going through it because the first week I was like 'This kinda sucks' with all of these people stuck inside the house, I don't really relate, I don't get it, and then it turned into like 'Hey, we get each other now' and then they start going home and I was like ""Oh, there less people here"", but then ""Oh yeah, it's a competition! We're not just cooking in a kitchen."" But, I will say it seemed like towards the end, I was edited to be very like 'Hey, this is how things are done' and that's just not entirely who I am, like I'm not that much of an asshole, but it definitely came off like 'Hey, he's a real ass.'""*

  
On another note, he also talked about his antagonistic edit in one of his Instagram Live clips, saying something along the lines of

*""It's also a competition with the big headed comment \[on his live video; possibly referring to the way he led the final service\]. Every chef was just as stern as I was, and I wanted to prove to them that I was just as stern as they were, and that was part of it. I was definitely tougher there than I am in a lot of kitchens I was managing, but at the end of the day, you got to be hard on the people and make sure that they do their best because in that kitchen, we were wanting to make the best food.""*"
Hellskitchen,0.69,"So Chef Ramsey pulled Egypt aside to give him a pep talk after Egypt had announced that he was quitting and bowing out of the competition. 

I honestly feel like Chef Ramsey did this basically to salvage this season and to prevent this season from being known as the season that had not one, not two, but THREE Chefs quit in about just as many episodes and all of them came from the same team. He doesn't want yet another episode where he doesn't send anyone home because people keep making the decision for him instead of the other way around. This was also probably an effort to not have to immediately rebalance the Blue team because Egypt trying to quit would automatically mean that the Blue team would need another member from the Red team to balance out the numbers on each team. 

I don't think Ramsey did this out of the kindness of his heart so much as it was to try and salvage this season and keep the ratings up because Egypt does add an interesting dynamic to the blue team as well as one of like....two consistent Challenges Chef (I don't think Egypt has failed to score in the Challenges).

DUMBO,1.0,"Hi all,

This crazy thing happened the other day, and I wanted to ask here if anyone know what led to it or what happened after. I can't get it off my mind.

I had just left the Time Out Market in Dumbo and was standing at the corner of Main St. and Plymouth St. waiting for a cab. Suddenly, an older, foreign male just behind me is panicking. He's with his wife and two daughters whom he tries to protect from something. He yells 3-4 times to a couple next to them to ""Call the police please"" and people start running around. Left is the man in front of his family and a this other very pale, psychotic looking man in a dark blue jacket.

The husband realizes that he's after him only and starts to run backwards down Plymouth St. away from his family. The other man, in the blue jacket, calmly walks directly after him. Like he's locked in. It looks like he's carrying something in his pocket at this point. Another male from the crowd runs after - and my cab arrived, so I left.

Curious if anyone were there, saw anything, or heard anything?"

I'm happy to report I requested rent history for my building and a lawyer has indeed confirmed I have reason to question whether the rent has been properly registered, and I'm now filing an overcharge complaint. The rent history proves the landlord was raising the rent against regulation, as well as registering multiple years at once... lots of fishiness. Several years ago I sued a different landlord for the same thing and won, so I feel happy to have this option again. 

  
If something feels off, follow your gut! Landlords are exploiting all of us and it's gone too far. Friendly reminder you can request the rent history for your building here: [https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask)"

My wife and i have signed a lease and are moving from Park Slope to Maplewood (surprise surprise). I am a Brooklynite through and through as I have extended family in BK and have lived in the Park Slope area for the past 10 years. We are moving so we can have a larger space as we are expecting later in the spring. This is something that my wife really wanted for so long as her parents aren‚Äôt too far away in NJ. I can‚Äôt help but feel a deep sadness that we are leaving Brooklyn. I love the neighborhood that we‚Äôre in, the walk ability of it, being close in proximity to my side of the family, and also all the travel options of flying out of LGA or JFK (even though we likely won‚Äôt be traveling a lot once the baby arrives).

I know it‚Äôs not a terrible train ride away‚Äîthough I hate NJ transit and Penn station‚Äîand most of my day to day won‚Äôt change *that* much since I wfh. Life will be crazy when the baby comes, so where we live isn‚Äôt going to matter that much as we are just going to focus on being new parents.

If your workplace offers this benefit, you can gift a free Urbansitter membership to petsitters you want to use and book them with work benefit credits (know from personal experience - catsit client recently gifted me an Urbansitter membership, so that I could be booked on that site).

Petsitters can also join Urbansitter memberships on their own, but I wouldn't recommend it for now since their petsitting section is still new and not used often. But if petsitters have clients that have this work benefit, you can let them know so that they can book you there.

ParkSlope,0.77,"This adorable trio‚ÄîFirecracker Comedy‚Äîhas a show at Union Hall 10pm tonight (10/24)! What can I say other than we‚Äôd just love to see you there. The lineup is really quite good, we play very fun music before the show, and the opening bit usually consists of the larger woman throwing around the two smaller ones. How cool does that sound? Stay awake for us, you‚Äôre not going to do much work tomorrow anyway! üß®‚ù§Ô∏è"
ParkSlope,0.88,"What‚Äôs up, I‚Äôm looking for a hair salon or hair stylist that I could have give me a good haircut as I haven‚Äôt gotten one here in New York. I stay in the park slope area and I‚Äôve been going to the same hair salon for years back in Florida but now since I moved I just don‚Äôt know where to go for my type of hair cut. I have straight hair but it starts to get wavy as it gets longer and flow-ier, similar to the link i attached but I‚Äôm looking because I have a wedding coming up and just need to get my hair looking right. I‚Äôd also like to get this ‚Äútextured flow‚Äù done with possibly a beard shaping up but primarily the hair cut. "

ParkSlope,0.98,Hi! Please share if possible!!
ParkSlope,0.75,If you lost one tonight LMK band and body color 
ParkSlope,0.78,"Park Slope is a famously cozy, walkable neighborhood. But I can barely squeeze past people on the 7th Ave sidewalk. Meanwhile there are two whole lanes of parking and two wide lanes of car traffic.

Has the city ever seriously considered widening the sidewalks ‚Äî or making any other big changes ‚Äî to 7th Ave?

Obviously such a change would be controversial. But I can't google any evidence that it's even been discussed.

EDIT: I'm interested in all the discussion of whether it *should* be done, but I actually wanted to know *if it's ever been seriously considered*. Can anyone remember any proposals, discussion at community meetings, etc. about redesigning 7th Ave? Or does anyone remember when and how it was redesigned in the past?"
ParkSlope,0.94,Anyone else hear these? Was woken up twice around 5am
ParkSlope,0.91,"Unsure if anyone is missing their cat, it was a tuxedo cat, spotted at the location shown above at 5:22 PM on October 21. I called a number on a lost cat sign but it wasn‚Äôt theirs. Cat ran down the little alleyway in third photo"
ParkSlope,0.93,Found these on the floor of the subway 
ParkSlope,0.93,Too excited high fiving people about the liberty and lost my favorite ring in process. If you see it  and DM me I will love you forever and pay you back in future liberty tickets!!! 
ParkSlope,0.85,I know a lot of places in the area cater to jazz/folk/acoustic stuff but specifically looking for bars that have live rock music and a house PA-not like a bigger music venue but a spot that is mostly a bar and just happens to have bands sometimes. Bonus if there is video poker and a pool table! For my older folks: something akin to the old Trash Bar/Continental/Ottos Shrunken Head. Thanks!ü§òüé∏ü•Å
ParkSlope,0.77,"

So random but I was at the park last night and we started packing up to leave around 6:50pm. As we are walking out of the big open field and onto the path, we see a guy hiding behind a tree. He was in a varsity jacket and looked pretty young. All the sudden sirens start going off and all of us watch the guy RUN over to another tree and literally climb up into it. We all stood and were like wtf‚Ä¶.. and then we see the cop car fly by obviously looking for the guy but they didn‚Äôt see him in the tree. Any idea on what happened?? Curiosity is killing me!"
ParkSlope,0.37,I walked past and giggled hehe
ParkSlope,0.65,"I know dogs pretty well. I go to off-leash hours in Prospect Park every day. And I see people - especially on weekends - taking small children there and letting them wander on their own on the field among the dogs. And I think it‚Äôs crazy and wondered if these parents get it.

I understand why dogs often find children unpredictable and potentially dangerous and why dogs attack kids. Small children are at the same time the source of a potential poke in the eye or a grab of the tail, and also doable for most dogs who are medium sized and larger. Even some smaller dogs could maul a child and dogs are very sensitive to ‚Äúbeing dominated.‚Äù And I‚Äôve seen the most ‚Äúoh Boxer would never do that!‚Äù usually sweet dogs lash out when they don‚Äôt feel safe in front a child. 

So imagine if a ball flies astray on that field  and a dog goes to fetch it and ends up suddenly face to face with your kid on the field. Do you, parents of these kids, ever consider that? Anyone else thinking the same thing?"
ParkSlope,1.0,"We saw this cat on Sterling between 6th and 7th Ave about 6 pm. He was calmly sitting on an apartment building stoop. If he is yours, DM me and I can send you the exact address. "
ParkSlope,0.63,"We're moving to Jersey City in about a month. Looking for moving recommendations. We are moving from a 1 bedroom (biggest items are: one bed+mattress, one dresser+nightstand, peloton, sofa, large TV, smoker) on first floor to a condo also on first floor.

First off, THANK YOU to everyone who commented on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/1fxsf7c/who_remembers_the_blog_fd_in_park_slope/) a couple weeks ago with questions for Erica Reitman, the founder of¬†[F‚Äôd in Park Slope](https://web.archive.org/web/20160123202234/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/).

ParkSlope,0.81,"Any bar like this in park slope? I‚Äôve only seen numerous pinball machines, never arcades. Looking for 80s/90s arcade machines. I know Barcade exists in wburg, but more curious if anything exists around here. "

I‚Äôm looking for outside skirt steak for a good Carne Asada.
Most skirt steak sold in stores is ‚Äúinside‚Äù skirt steak which comes from the flank.  
Outside Skirt comes from the plate section and is thicker, better marbled and more tender. 
If you know a guy, hit me up.

ParkSlope,0.58,"Sammy‚Äôs law was recently enacted which allows NYC to lower speed limits on specific streets. If there‚Äôs a large area of streets that are all being requested 20mph DOT might create a speed reduction zone for that area. The form will be live until 11/15, please share!

ParkSlope,0.32,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are planning to move to Park Slope with our two young kids, and we‚Äôre looking for some advice. We‚Äôre trying to figure out which areas of Park Slope are best for families and what the process is like for enrolling kids into schools around here.

Are there specific zones or schools that are highly recommended? Any tips on how the school enrollment process works, or things we should be aware of before moving? We‚Äôd appreciate any insights or advice from parents who have been through it!

Thanks in advance!"
ParkSlope,0.9,"Every time I go there, I resolve to try something different. And every time I get the chicken parmigiana hero, or the meatball parmigiana, or occasionally the eggplant parm. I'm not complaining about any of them because I like them a lot, but I also feel I should branch out.

What do you like? I get them from 7th Ave sometimes and  from 5th Ave other times--but it's the same menu. Linking to the [menu](http://www.russosmozzarellaandpasta.net/menu) in case you want to look at it to remember which ones you've tried.

Thanks!"
ParkSlope,0.92,Not sure if this exists anywhere but wondering if there is any kind of book exchange group in the neighborhood? I love the library but it often takes so long to get the books I want to read and would love to swap books instead of continuing to buy! 
ParkSlope,0.86,"Looking for a gym in north slope. Hoping to find somewhere that is max $100 a month. Also, really looking to find somewhere that‚Äôs welcoming to my scrawny self and has a nice social vibe. Would be awesome to meet some people through it so I look forward to going. Feel like Slope Fitness may best meet that criteria? "
ParkSlope,0.33,"I am moving within NYC right now, and I found a great apartment at 5th and Union. Everything looks great. I would love to be this close to the park. My only concern is noise, since this is a 2nd floor apt facing 5th Ave. In particular, I noticed that there's a taco truck at that intersection.

My question for Park Slope locals is: would you move there? Would you share these concerns? I currently live in Jackson Heights, so I have a hard time imagining this apt will be noisier. But I would hate to find out that I couldn't open my front window without smelling fumes from the truck, for example. So any info on how noisy the street is, how often the taco truck is there, if it's always on 5th or sometimes on Union, etc.

  
Thanks for the help!"
ParkSlope,1.0,Hi! Wondering if there are any grocery stores in Park Slope that sell paneer? Looking for an Indian brand -- not cottage cheese. I've been to a few stores but haven't any luck yet. Thanks!
ParkSlope,0.84,"Looking to sit at a bar and listen to some live music Friday evening 7-9. Not looking for a venue. 

Any places like this in the area?  "
ParkSlope,0.67,"we are looking for someone to watch our dog while we have some people over this Friday night. We were thinking something along the lines of 6 PM to midnight, where our dog can just hang out in the sitters home. He is reactive so he doesn‚Äôt get along with other dogs and he‚Äôs a really sweet boy when it‚Äôs just one person yet 20 people at once can freak him out which is why we want to give him some space when we have people over that night. I‚Äôve looked on Rover, but it‚Äôs kind of hard to request someone to just watch the dog for an evening. Does anyone know of any sitters who do this in particular? We have some sitters but none of them do boarding for a few hours. Thanks!"
ParkSlope,1.0,I‚Äôm a beginner already working with an online French tutor once a week. Looking for an in person tutor/class to supplement. 
ParkSlope,0.84,"My keys fell out of my pocket this morning, likely in Prospect Park in the Long Meadow area. However, I was in several areas of the park, so they could be anywhere.

They have green and black keychain tags on them. I can identify the words on the keychain to confirm my identity. Please DM me if you've found any. Thank you!"
ParkSlope,0.91,"Hi all! First, sorry if this post isn't allowed.

I wanted to put a feeler out to see if any park slope musicians were in need of a place to rehearse. I have a spot just outside of the neighborhood (Gowanus, 2nd ave) that has some availability for an additional renter, and it made sense to me to check in with my neighbors. It's open 24/7 and is fully equipped with gear, has wi-fi, etc. 

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or interest! "
ParkSlope,0.95,"Has anyone heard anything meaningful from the DEP/DOT regarding the growing sinkhole and water main leak in the middle of the intersection of 8th Avenue and 14th street? 

I made a 311 inquiry yesterday and the text I received this morning says they closed the complaint file a whole two minutes after it was submitted to DEP. 

every time I walk by the surface of the road looks more precarious and while they‚Äôve put out some cones, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before someone really eats it when surface eventually gives way.

FortGreene,1.0,"Hey there,

  
I'm looking at an apartment on Clermont about a third of the block up past the BQE. Had a friend visit and claim the noise wasn't noticeable, but wanted people's opinions on how it is living up there. Ft. Greene is my favorite neighborhood on earth but obviously dont want to slowly lose my mind. 

  
Thank you! "
FortGreene,0.94,"Did anyone else hear the weird booming by the BQE tonight and last night around 7:50? Sounded like thunder mixed with fireworks, but doesn‚Äôt seem like it was either. "
FortGreene,1.0,Does anybody know the story behind it? It‚Äôs been driving me crazy for *years*. It‚Äôs a lot that has the green construction fencing and then an insane amount of what I‚Äôve always assumed is bamboo growing behind it. I know bamboo is very hard to get rid of once it‚Äôs taken root but it‚Äôs a prime lot location so has always surprised me it‚Äôs never been built on. Anybody have details? 
FortGreene,1.0,Anyone have an idea what's going on with the liquor store at the corner of Fulton and St. Felix?  At this point the store is 70% empty and when it's full it has a poor selection.  Its been shuttered by the city a few times since 2021 but always rises like the phoenix.
FortGreene,0.86,"Hello Everyone! 

Over the past few months, I have been working with City Point to start a running club in the Downtown Brooklyn to serve the surrounding communities surrounding the neighborhood.

I have been a runner since 2006 and have been a run coach for the last 8 years as well.

My goal is to bring people together through running and building a community with people that not just share the passion, but also not familiar with running and want to explore new activities.  

We have already brought on partnerships with Caf√© d‚ÄôAvignon and Lululemon with more partnerships to come.  Currently, we are running every Saturday at 830am from City Point and would love to have anyone who wants to join to come by!

Feel free to message me with questions, also, I will answer all questions here as well.  You can also find me on Instagram at [Brooklyn Running Society](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynrunningsociety/).  Please come out and support your local club"

I also love that it seems a little older and more mature than the artsy party vibe I get from Bushwick, but there‚Äôs still plenty to see/do within the neighborhood. "
FortGreene,1.0,"Anyone have any luck purchasing one-day passes to play on tennis courts in Fort Greene (or any NYC park I guess). 

Since I'm just getting back into tennis now, so late in the season, and I don't have a regular partner to play with I figured it'd make more sense to just buy one-day passes for the times I find people to play with, rather than buy a season pass just for two months, not even knowing how often or if I'll get to play. 

I assumed you could buy a pass the day of since you have to sign up in-person the day of for courts in Ft Greene, but apparently you buy it online and they MAIL it to you like it's 1996. (Here's the [link](https://www.nycgovparks.org/permits/tennis-permits/single-play/apply) to the info)

FortGreene,1.0,"I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself, but looking for suggestions for a 1st birthday party space in the neighborhood. I really don‚Äôt want to do a traditional ‚Äúparty room‚Äù at a kid space and pay $1000 for bad pizza and a swift 2hr cap. I‚Äôd love to host something at my apartment but there really isn‚Äôt room.

Birthday is in January so has to be indoors. 

Ideally I‚Äôd just like an open space where the kids can crawl/run around, we can bring some toys, and the adults can hang and talk. Maybe bring in something like Moozika for the kids. Basically looking for the indoor version of a picnic in the park.

His wife with his was antagonizing as well repeating that ‚Äúyall don‚Äôt own this park‚Äù.  It was pretty insane for what is usually a calm friendly dog park. We were worried he was going to bring his park into the gates to rip everyone‚Äôs dog to shreds. Someone was recording and he flipped out about that as well, curious if the video ever made it online?

CobbleHill,1.0,"Hello there! 

My partner and I are considering Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights for our move to NYC next year. 

We‚Äôve walked through Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights during the day and fell in love with it due how much cleaner it is than other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. 

We also noticed that part of the reason why it‚Äôs so clean is there weren‚Äôt as many trash castles on the streets because of the trash enclosures/bins with lids on the outside of many brownstones. This was of course only during a short visit. 

How bad is the rat problem when walking in Cobble Hill after sundown? We have to walk our dog pretty late at night and don‚Äôt mind seeing a rat or two but want to avoid moving somewhere where the situation is too intense. 

Side note: I know every neighborhood in NYC has rats or mice or even roaches. Just trying to find a neighborhood that is cleaner and not as intense as the others. 

Thank you!

You can bring them over ANY time you'd like and you can leave them in the yard or on the front steps (Google for address) there is several ""no trespassing signs"" because we do unfortunately have way to many thefts.  But if you're bringing pumpkins over you can just walk up to the door and drop them off outside on the steps. I really appreciate it and if you have any questions feel free to comment. Thanks!

CrownHeights,0.88,"EDIT: Posted in subreddit r/Brooklyn too

EDIT: I‚Äôm a 28 year old woman for context

Had a strange encounter recently and wanted to get some advice or thoughts. I‚Äôve seen a boy, about 13 or 14, in my Brooklyn neighborhood a few times who‚Äôs part of the Hasidic community and autistic. He‚Äôs asked me for the time and for a hug a few times (declined the latter).

One day, I noticed him following me as I walked home. I crossed the street a couple of times to see if it was just a coincidence, but he kept following. Eventually, he asked me for the time, which I gave him, but then he immediately asked if he could hug me. I said no.

After that, he asked if we could be friends and if he could walk me home. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and said, ""Sure, why not,"" since my apartment was only a block away. When we got to my place, though, he asked again if we could be friends and tried to hug me again, and I said no both times. He then tried to follow me up my stoop into the building while asking a bunch of questions about my schedule, what I do, etc.

While I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs harmless, what worries me is that he never seems to be in school, and he‚Äôs out quite late. My husband plays soccer late at night and has mentioned seeing this kid wandering outside by himself pretty often, without any parents or supervision. He once saw my husband run by (in a rush to make a soccer game) and tried to shake his hand so waited on the block 2 hours for my husband to walk by again so he could shake his hand. It was 12am at night. 

It definitely caught me off guard, and maybe I‚Äôm the asshole or overreacting. 

Anybody have anything like this happen?"

The current rent is $2150 paid online through a portal. One months security deposit. No brokers fee if going through me to take over! 

Hardwood floors and exposed brick. Two big windows in the living area, a window in the kitchen and a window in the bathroom. 

I live on the second floor of a three floor building. No dishwasher or laundry in the building but very affordable wash and fold around the corner.

* **Color**: Natural wood color

All we ask is that you pick it up. We're hoping it finds a home where it can be just as useful and appreciated.

Side note: the futon is a bit heavy, but it can be disassembled. Me and my wife carried the entire thing for 5 blocks until we got to the train stations, then 4 more blocks into our apartment.

I don't use social media (no, I'm not a luddite, I just think it's a useless time suck). I mean, the only other way to see what's happening in the neighborhood are the flyers up in the entrance of Furry Fiends or at Darling Coffee.

Inwood,0.5,"Hello creators of M.CüòÅ,
        
                  Truly, I appreciate all the time and effort you put into this game. You have so many opportunities for players. My three requests are Streets signs, access to the skins menu inside any world, and beer that causes drunkness. The street sign is just a sign thats two blocks wide, one block tall, and a big text size that you can adjust. The access to skin menu in any world would just be the same as the one in your hanger, just the access of that inside your world so you can change skins without having to exit your world. Last is just a beer bottle that will cause drunkness to a player which will make the player dizzy and move slow. All three are just to make the game better and more realistic. Thank you for your cooperation with me and other people, and I hope you will take my suggestions into consideration. Thank you!

          Your Minecraft fan and player,

They typically have the best variants available from the stores I've visited, and I like the owner and the skate shop a lot, and they have really good discounts for members. Plus, it's only 15 minutes away from my place. 

However, there are a few books that I have been waiting months to get. Every week they check and place an order on the issues I'm missing, and they say it should arrive real quick. But every week it's not here. I'd go to another store, but Bulletproof says it would mess up their numbers if a variant is ordered and not picked up. Anyone here know if there's a LCS near the 5/2 lines that has consistent pulls of indie comics and variants?"

Flatbush,1.0,"Hello, my husband and I were visiting Brooklyn (where he‚Äôs from) last week. On Monday 8/12 we took an Uber from the Ave H station on the Q train line on Ave H and East 16th street to a tattoo shop near Ave N and Flatbush Ave. The Uber was a white minivan and I was seated in the back behind the driver. I‚Äôm pretty sure I lost my ring in that Uber. If you were in there after we were and you found my ring, or if you know someone who did, I would gladly pay a cash reward for it! We have followed up with Uber and every place we went since leaving that day but so far we haven‚Äôt tracked down the ring.

It is a gold engagement ring with a square stone in the center and two smaller darker triangular stones on either side. This ring is incredibly sentimental to me and means more than I can put into words. I‚Äôve been devastated since realizing it‚Äôs gone.

We went to Tzarline Tattoo Studio briefly, on Avenue N off Flatbush, then Bullseye Sports Pub on Flatbush Avenue and Avenue P. Then we went to Lenny &amp; John‚Äôs Pizza on Flatbush Ave between Avenue P and Flatlands Ave, before taking the B82 bus to the Kings Highway Q Train Station back to Avenue H.

Again it is a three stone engagement ring, which I can provide pictures of and any info leading to tracking it down would be very much appreciated!! I know it‚Äôs a long shot but I can‚Äôt imagine losing this ring, it means so much to me, so please if you‚Äôve found it or heard about someone else finding it, let them know we‚Äôd be happy to reward them if they can return it!

Thank you!!!"

Flatbush,0.88,"Hi neighbors,

I moved into a new apartment on Lenox Rd/Rogers Ave a couple of months ago. I have had a car and parked on the street for the past 5 years in a few different neighborhoods, so I like to think I know what's going on when it comes to NYC parking rules, written and unwritten. But here I am after a full 90 minutes of alternate side parking on Lenox Rd, and I haven't seen a single car move, no one is double parked, no street cleaner has come, and no traffic cops. Today is not a parking holiday (4/4).

So, what gives? I know that the street cleaner goes up Rogers Ave. I've never seen any of the typical ASP activity here on Lenox though or any nearby streets. Is this just informally not enforced? Does street cleaning only actually occur occasionally? Do I even have to move my car for this? Thanks to any longer tenured resident who can shed some light on this!"

Flatbush,1.0,"For several weeks, a few times per week, I've heard a distressed dog near my block. I think someone is putting their dog on the fire escape or the roof at night. Last night, the dog cried very loudly from 4am to 7am and it was below freezing outside.

I'm on the northeast corner of Linden and Rogers. The dog is not in my building and I cannot see it. It sounds like it's coming from the north within a block or two, but since our windows are above a courtyard, it's possible I'm hearing an echo from a different direction than the dog.

If you live on this block and have been awake between midnight and 7am in the last few weeks, you've probably heard this dog.

Flatbush,1.0,"Hey, BK resident here looking to explore Flatbush a bit. My grandparents grew up in the area &amp; I'd love to be able to show them some pictures of places they might remember from when they were young. Any restaurants or businesses in the area that are known as long-running staples.

It's plausible there are no restaurants that are 80+ years old in an area with so many 'eras'/demographic changes throughout the period, and Google has been a dead end, so figured this is the best presearch I can do before just meandering around &amp; seeing if businesses look old/have ""established"" signs."

Flatbush,1.0,"Has anyone been by Wonderpets / 'Wonder Pets Corp' at 969 Flatbush Ave? That shit was so clearly fucked, dogs without adequate food, water, and space, very obviously being mistreated, starved, and abused. The shop advertises a grooming service in the back but the dogs all have mangy matted fur with hamster chips stuck to them. I found a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@reportwp111) that's been documenting mistreatment there for a month, but disturbing online reviews go back a lot longer. Is it possible to get this place shut down???"

GreenwichVillage,1.0,"Hello!

We are researchers affiliated with Syracuse University who are interested in better understanding sexual minority women‚Äôs mental health. We are recruiting folks who identify with diverse sexual identities (e.g., queer, same gender-loving) and gender identities (e.g., trans, nonbinary). Specifically, the purpose of our research study is to identify ways that sexual minority women have been affected by trauma, including their coping strategies. 

We are recruiting participants to take part in our online research study, consisting of a brief (5 minute) screener to determine eligibility. After, eligible participants will be directed to the main study, which involves a 45-60-minute online initial survey and 14 brief daily surveys, each of which take approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Thus, the entirety of the research study will be completed online and take approximately 2-3.5 hours total, with 45-60 minutes on your first day. You must be between 18 and 64 years of age to participate.

For participating in this paid study, you can earn up to $35 cash compensation via an electronic Amazon gift card (for an alternative payment method, please email study staff at mstlab@syr.edu). Specifically, if you only complete the baseline survey, you will earn $10.00. If you complete the 14-day assessment, you can earn $1 for each daily survey (14 days in total), $5 if you complete all daily entries in the first 7 days and $6 if you complete all 14 daily entries = $25. Thus, you will receive some compensation regardless of the amount of time spent in the study.

Please complete the following brief (&lt; 5 minutes), online Eligibility Screening Questionnaire at your earliest convenience to confirm eligibility for this study. You can click the following link (or ‚Äúcut and paste‚Äù the link into your preferred Internet browser): [https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3jZ35KOYT0v8QrH](https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3jZ35KOYT0v8QrH)

If you are eligible and wish to participate in this study, you will be taken to the 45-60-minute online initial survey immediately following the screener survey. After you complete the initial survey, we will get in touch with you in the next 1-2 weeks to complete the 14-day daily survey. 

Thank you again for your interest in our study! Please feel free to pass along this announcement to other sexual minority women who might be interested in participating in our study. Please email us at mstlab@syr.edu if you have any questions.

GreenwichVillage,1.0,Those were the days..miss the people who sat hours talking
GreenwichVillage,1.0,"I‚Äôm on a group for unresolved murders/missing people. I lurk, but never post. Today I saw a post from a dad who was looking for answers or at the very least witnesses to his sons supposed ‚Äúhit-and-run‚Äù accident that occurred September 18,2006. His post pleaded:

&gt;‚ÄùTo anyone who has lived in Greenwich Village for 13 years or longer. This is my son Joshua David Crouch. Josh lost his life on September 18, 2006. And as of today we still have no closure. This was a hit and run on the corner of Westside highway and West 12 street. Supposedly no one saw this happen? Really? This is in the heart of the meat packing district. And, also supposedly at 3:30 Monday morning. I stood on that corner for 24 hours a few weeks after this happened and it is a very busy area. Does anyone in the city recall this? Can someone come forward with information? As we here know, our pain never goes away and Josh being gone has left such a hole in our hearts. Josh has a brother Eric who is now 32, and Kristen who is now 28. Eric‚Äôs first child and our first grandchild (grandson) will arrive next week and as an honor to Eric‚Äôs brother he is naming him Easton Joshua Crouch. This accident can still be looked up online. I could go on and on about my visits to the city concerning people I spoke with and walked with for many years trying to find out something. Mysteriously, people I spoke to all of a sudden stopped corresponding with me. Police, first responders, ADA Eliot Felig, newspaper editor and even mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs assistant at the time. This didn‚Äôt happen in a secluded park or rest stop, and If anyone has ever been to this corner at the river and park one knows that this is a busy area of NYC at all times of the day. In closing, People talk and someone knows something. If, by any chance there is information of who did this, on my word you will remain anonymous. Please help.....‚Äù

For some reason this post hit me and I commented. This was Joshua‚Äôs father‚Äôs reply to me after I suggested maybe this was something more than a hit-and-run‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄùThat's crazy [gresh88] that is exactly what we think. My wife never felt like this was the spot. Josh was supposedly three times the drunk limit and they (Bogus NYPD) say he walked from the bar ""Employees Only"" at 510 Huston Street to Westside hwy and West 12th street and then was hit crossing to go to the park at the river. He was maybe 140 pounds soaking wet and never, ever would have made it that far. That's it, that's how they left it. They basically pushed me aside. Very mysterious deeds by New York's finest.‚Äù


I did a little more digging online and found another post from what looks like his father 1 year after the ‚Äúaccident(?)‚Äù occurred on another website. This is what he wrote regarding what happened to Joshua:

&gt;‚ÄùOn September 18,2006, my son Joshua aka LEFTist of Brooklyn, New York was killed in the early morning hours on the street in the West Village of New York. To this day, almost a year later there are no witnesses, clues or new information by the NYPD. This police force was/is neglegent in their investigation of my son's death. West 12 Street and West Street (or known by some as The Westside Highway) is a very well lit area near the Hudson River Park at all times of the day. This area is also well traveled at all hours of the day. Yet, according to the NYPD, there were no witnesses and Josh apparently lay in the middle lane for nearly an hour before being &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; by to police officers. When found, Josh was already cold (which takes at least an hour to occur). Josh is a founding member of the hip-hop crew Mindspray from the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and was/is well admired by those who know him. Is this a cover up by the NYPD because one of their own was driving drunk and mowed Josh down? Was Josh beaten and thrown from a fast moving vehicle? The M.E. said that Joshua's facial injuries were some of the worst he has seen. A police sergeant told me, then later recanted his story that &amp;quot;I have been a police officer for a long time and the injuries to your son's face were not from a vehicle, but most likely from some type of instrument, maybe a bat&amp;quot;! Two weeks later this sergeant said he never said anything like that. I have been asked, &amp;quot;why was Josh on streets at 3:30 A.M.? in New York there are alway's people on the streets.‚Äù


To me there definitely seems to be more to this story than what has been offered to this poor family. I think this one hit me because of how likely it could happen to anyone and how a parent never stops loving their children and even more than 10 years later this father is still looking for answers. 

Do any of you know anything about this? Are familiar with this area? Could provide this man answers to his sons death?

GreenwichVillage,0.99,"I am producing a low budget (really low) documentary. I want to interview an author of a related book but the venue I thought I might use is way to expensive.

Does anyone know of a good place to sit for a quiet talk that will be recorded on video? Maybe a legit place in NYU?"
GreenwichVillage,1.0,"When the Cedar Tavern closed in 2006, we purchased their 50 foot, mahogany bar.  It's being lovingly restored and will live out it's second life in our new restaurant in Austin, opening in September 2016, called Eberly. We intend to celebrate it's history by displaying photos and artifacts celebrating it in the space. DO YOU HAVE PHOTOS or ARTIFACTS that you'd like to share with us?  We are looking for images of the outside of the restaurant/bar/tavern in any of it's various locations throughout the years. We'd also love to see photos of the mahogany bar in it's former glory."
GreenwichVillage,1.0,"THE MODS OF /R/WEDDINGPLANNING SUGGESTED I POST HERE:

Getting ready to pop the question to my girlfriend.

I lived in the **Bronx** and **Westchester County** the first half of my life. I now live elsewhere in New York State. I spent a large amount of my free time in Manhattan when I was younger. The two of us are likely going to be back in NYC for a couple days next month, so I had the inkling to ask her while we were there.

The question is how and where? I want to avoid cliche and touristy spots. Although I never lived there myself, I was in the **Lower East Side** as much as possible when I was a young indie-rock/raver bridge-and-tunnel kid. I gravitated towards the bohemian culture of NYC as much as possible. I made **Astor Place/St. Marks/Tompkins Square/Alphabet City** my constant hangouts. So if that gives any sense of the flavor I might want to stick to... Or what ideas/spots I would abhor or want to avoid.

My first two ideas I had are both a bust. Well the second one might be able to be modified.

First one was that I had a connection to get us into a taping of the **Daily Show**. Her and I both share the same sense of humor and we love comedy/satire/etc. My connection was going to try to set something up where I might be able to propose on-set prior to the taping (with J.S. being involved in some schticky way). But Jon Stewart ended up going on sabbatical, so I ended up thinking it didn't have the same sensibility with the fill-in host there.

Second idea centered around my girlfriend's predisposition towards things vintage/ancestral/genealogical, and also the fact that my family has this rich history in the NYC immigrant story. I wanted to plan a whole day of immigrant-related historical stuff: **Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Tenement Museum in** (what is left of) **Little Italy**. Then I wanted to conclude it by going to the spot where my great-grandmother lived after she came over from Italy.

I'm finding I wasn't the only one in my family with a connection to the LES. I always assumed my great-grandmother lived in Little Italy, but just discovered she really lived in what's now **Alphabet City**. Also my uncle lived just off **Tompkins Square** when he was a beatnik painter in the early 60's.

Part of these immigrant and LES-related themes I'm trying to brainstorm within stems from the fact that I am giving my girlfriend an **antique ring** owned by my great-grandmother that I recently had restored.

Here's the problem with my great-grandmother's former residence and proposing there: They have since turned the entire block she lived on into a giant **ConEd power substation** that is not publicly accessible (not that I would want to propose there if it was, obviously).

My girlfriend is *not* from the **NYC-Metro area** and has no real connections to it (other than her ancestors likely passed through Ellis Island, even if they didn't live in NYC). She definitely has no shared experiences regarding the LES. So if I did anything related to that, I'd have to find a way to fold her into the story somehow... Or present it in some context of me revealing my past and 'turning my whole person over to her', as cheesy as that sounds.

She also loves art and museums. The last time we were there, I took her to the **Guggenheim** for the first time and she was in her glory. Would want to balance any idea related to that with my 'non-touristy' requirement.



**tl;dr:** So basically I am fielding for ideas for proposing to my girlfriend in NYC that are either:

* Related to immigrant history, either in general, or on a personal, familial level
* Related to the LES and its culture, and my personal/familial connection to it
* Non-touristy/non-status quo; Perhaps a bit more genuine NYC cred, while still involving her
* Art/museum-related"

LenoxHill,1.0,"Without getting into my personal opinion about humane treatment let‚Äôs just do the math. A patient was given 30 pills 10 days ago. This patient has chronic pain. The recommended maximum dose per day is not to exceed 4 grams where the maximum per pill is 650 mgs except when there is breakthrough pain and then it‚Äôs recommended to take as needed. 4 grams is 4,000 mgs. The strongest dose at 4 grams per day would be (650 x 6.15) 6 pills per day max WITHOUT allowing for breakthrough at all EVER, 30 pills would last FIVE DAYS. The lowest dose available is 325. 1-2 pills are recommended. 4 grams per day (325 x 12.3) 12 pills per day WITHOUT allowing for breakthrough pain ever would last 2.5 days. 

Now may I put this in terms that more relatable for people without chronic pain? You are given enough of ANYTHING to allow bare minimum to meet the demand you have. You have just enough gas to get to work and back until payday. You have just enough electricity to cool/heat your home for the month. You have just enough food to feed your family for the week. You have just enough of anything to make it to when you can replenish. 

Then you‚Äôre told that you need to cut back what you‚Äôve used to squeak by 50%. 

I don‚Äôt know or care what your opinion is on medical care and opioid abuse but based solely on treating another human humanely please tell me why or how this would be acceptable. 

I was watching Lenox hill and thoroughly enjoying the compassion, the humanity of these doctors until a particular patient was blatantly under treated and frustrated simply because of misperceptions.

LenoxHill,0.9,"Many of their patients have incurable diseases, but they still say stuff like ""the surgery was a success, we got it all out"", ""I'm happy, you should be happy"" and so on. Of course the surgery is successful when they succeed in what they were planning to do, but they make it sound as if they cured the patient when unfortunately in most cases it's more about prolonging their lives for a few months (which can be huge in itself, I'm sure, as for the guy whose daughter got married). I think this gives a false sense of optimism to the viewer at least, if not to the patients. To Phyllis, they also said something like: ""everything went fine"" and she was like ""great, so it's not cancer?"" And the doctor was like ""Well, about that.."" I'm sure they are trained in this kind of talks, but why are they sugarcoating so much? Sure, you don't want to scare people, but you can still be calm and compassionate without giving false hope?"

LowerEastSide,1.0,"Hi! I'm a soon-to-be college graduate moving to the East Side this month, and I‚Äôm hoping to get your advice:

Over the summer, I created a really fun arts and creativity program for children in my suburban New York neighborhood. I planned all the art sessions myself, brought supplies to my neighbors' homes, and worked with the kids one-on-one or in very small groups. Together, we made puppets, paintings, dioramas, sculptures, artistic treasure hunts, movies, and original soundtracks. I taught interdisciplinary creative skills like songwriting, GarageBand music production, film scoring, and filmmaking. I loved teaching these creativity sessions, and the kids were SO into it!

**My question is:**¬†when I move to the city, do you think families on the East Side and other areas would be interested in this as an individualized after-school/weekend program? Do you think my ‚ÄúArt of Creativity‚Äù program would be viable here, and if so, how should I go about finding kids to work with? Parents, would something like this appeal to you?

For one-on-one sessions, I currently charge $30 an hour, $45 for an hour and a half, $55 for two hours, or $80 for three hours. Do you think this aligns with city rates for extracurriculars/private lessons? I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights you can share!

And if anyone would like to discuss arranging a session for their child, please feel free to message me ‚Äî I‚Äôd be happy to set something up! :)

Thank you so much!"

LowerEastSide,1.0,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm writing this on behalf of my father, who works as an Uber Eats delivery driver. He‚Äôs in his 60s and isn‚Äôt very familiar with reddit.

Sadly, today my dad discovered that his **moped** (title says scooter, I got confused), which he relies on for his Uber Eats deliveries and livelihood, was stolen in the Lower East Side, right in front of the NYPD 7th Precinct.

He thought it would be safe since it was parked with a rain cover in front of the police station, but unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt deter the thief.

He has already reported the theft to the police, but he‚Äôs understandably very upset. I‚Äôm posting this to raise awareness that the thieves are using vans to steal scooters, so please be extra careful with yours. Also, if anyone spots the scooter in the pictures (streets, online, shop, etc...), any info would be greatly appreciated.

This is a huge blow because he spent $1,800 on the scooter and was hoping to recover that money through his deliveries. Sadly, it only lasted about one and a half month.

I know paying for insurance can be a trash, but let this serve as a reminder that it can be a lifesaver in situations like this. Unfortunately, my dad didn‚Äôt have insurance, so that‚Äôs been a tough lesson for him.

LowerEastSide,0.89,"If you live in or visit the LES, you've likely seen Felix Morelo's ""spot"" art - particularly in Tomkins Square &amp; Washington Square Parks. Best known for the ""Good Luck Spot"", he's also posted ""Bad Luck Spot"", ""Healing Spot"", ""Kissing Spot"", ""Pooping Spot"",  ""Screaming Spot"", ""Farting Spot"", etc etc. His Instagram is: [https://www.instagram.com/morelofelix/](https://www.instagram.com/morelofelix/)

Recently, he's been drawing ""Su\*cide Spot"" around - and getting mixed reactions to say the least. I only know this because I checked out his Instagram this afternoon. People are rightly reacting to that particular word - usually by smudging it out; sometimes by engaging in comments. Felix's response has been belligerent. Unimportant, he says,  that people might feel triggered by this. He's a mighty ""artist just doing his work"". And he'll post pics &amp; vids of people 'defacing' his work, playing the victim and claiming to only 'want to start a conversation'.

And *why*, you ask, did I check out his Instagram today? Because I woke up this morning, ready to tackle the challenges of the day - went onto my balcony, looked straight down and saw this:

[Somebody smudged out the word, but it remains recognizable.](https://preview.redd.it/uksk7xc0qdwd1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33b322e4ca0caddae5640aea7bf724663da601e0)

Looks like Felix also 'hit' the outside of a children's pre-school daycare center with a Su\*cide Spot as well:

https://preview.redd.it/twphezt9qdwd1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9648a2dcfaa81f66d65fe680ec52358d1c32003e

Now... I've been in NYC since 2002 - I am 1000% a supporter of street / guerrilla art, graffiti, and content that is challenging and insubordinate. I am a professional musician by trade; I'm rebellious by nature &amp; broadly hate the powers that be in this country. Life hasn't been easy for artists.... well ever, but particularly the past few years.

Waking up ready to try &amp; tackle the daily nonsense, then looking straight down to a ""Su\*cide Spot"" kinda knocked the wind out of my sails. Like it was a direct message from the Universe to me in particular. And I don't need that shit, no-one really does.

I'm doing OK-ish these days - particularly in my own work &amp; art, but coming to a place of uneasy equilibrium has not been easy &amp; has taken enormous effort and resolve. Since 2019, I have struggled with serious clinical depression, suicidality, self-harm, and my own self worth &amp; mental health. At my darkest point, I spent 2 Christmas evenings completely alone, on top of my former building, chain-smoking and fighting an internal battle of whether to fling myself to the sidewalk or not. Extremely grim - but it's the truth. I am glad (and amazed) that I emerged from that era of my life, tbh.

While I usually take a lot of living in NYC in stride (you have to to survive here), this \*particular\* message felt... cruel? personal? unfair? petty? I dunno. I turned to Instagram as one does these days, and posted the following:

https://preview.redd.it/qx70b3amrdwd1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b724608fe15dcd08da69fee31634def2ae60ee0

Basically saying the same as I've written here. I'm no prude to art &amp; life being edgy. But this one hit different.

To my surprise, Felix actually REPOSTED my comments. For the attention, I suppose? What a grifter.

Then, we had the following exchange in DMs:

https://preview.redd.it/3pflncn8sdwd1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9eae47be0de9d04c52f8d7849cb503b8f7769f8

So, to recap, Felix:

1. Is ""the artist"", just fated to ""do his work"". (oh pobrecito)
2. Thinks that if people are triggered, they are ""cowards"", ""weak"", and are blaming others.

It is really really against my ethos to erase / alter another person's artwork, \*especially\* if it is challenging to society, power, politics, preconceptions, etc. I believe in artists and *the people.* I abhor censorship. But this art piece itself, plus his belligerence in response, made this feel like he was punching down both on me and anyone else who ""suffers in silence"". I felt shocked, shitty, and almost *personally* targeted (I know that's not really the case, but still). Life is hard enough without this minor hurtful bullshit to wake up to. So I decided to go down and spray it away. I needed to.

These were the thoughts I shared after doing so:

https://preview.redd.it/p55yi63eudwd1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfe46544d26a0c20f7a3d7f97ffdd72f5c461a14

*""... for me to erase another artist's work is a MASSIVE departure from my general ethos, it literally feels as sinful as book banning / burning. And yet... the relief and empowerment I felt as I hosed away this particular piece can't be denied. The fact that \[Felix\] works with chalk as a medium - and responded the way he did over DM - highlights his inherent cowardice. He's reposted my criticism, hinting that he cares mostly about clout &amp; attention. And refusing to acknowledge that 'su\*cide' is a triggering term for some people - particularly \*\*if they see it right under their fucking balcony\*\* - means they lack empathy &amp; awareness, key traits of truly artistic individuals (instead of attention seeking poseurs) ... \[Hey Felix\], maybe think with more compassion before throwing out the S word, and at the very least don't do it under the balconies of people whose life stories you don't even fucking know. K thanks"".*

Later in the day, Felix messaged me saying that Instagram had taken down his repost of my comments (but not my original post) because it goes against Instagram's policy: ""*It looks like you shared something that may lead others to harm themselves*"".

And I'm like, YEAH NO SH\*T man! Maybe you should consider the same before scribbling it all over New York City!

[After this, he replied \\""You can hope all you want. I am still going to do my artwork\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/eadqpxwvudwd1.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ff1e1618151f8d7c47b18fd930fa49329db3681)

(It's likely that one of his followers reported the content, which I suppose I'd advocate for.)

On the bright side: I got a *lot* of feedback from friends on this, most of whom are extremely empathetic artists, musicians, NYers, rebels, etc etc and their resounding opinion was ""f that guy"".

Anyway, that's my story today - thanks for letting me vent. Before today I was bemused but mostly indifferent to the ""work"" of Felix Morelo when I walked past / over it. Now, knowing where he stands on this, I think he's a troll and a washed-up, mediocre coward who lacks the insight and courage to create art with permanence. Thus I have no qualms about hastening its impermanence.

The world keeps turning, and like everyone else I have real shit to deal with day to day. My daily obligations continued despite this unkind annoyance this morning. I've already given this guy way more attention than it deserves. But maybe my posting this is useful somehow - if nothing else, to get it off my own chest. I don't know.

LowerEastSide,0.5,"I live in the Lower East Side on Pike Street. Out of the blue I see payers outside of my building charging the face of our building a different very bright color and then spray painting a ton of graffiti. Then later this day I saw a really tiny font sign down the block saying there was a film shooting the next day. I called my leasing office and they confirmed that the film was being shot in and around our building but before I called them there was no notice to tenants. 

I am a renter not an owner but this all just seems unfair to tenants. Netflix is basically vandalizing our building for their wack film and I as a citizen, community member, and tenant have to just stay out of the film crews was as they are in my hallway. Today is film day and there are about 100 crew members in front of my house. I have a dog and basically have to ask permission to exit and enter my building. 

This is a very diverse mostly working class neighborhood in LES, so it doesn‚Äôt help that the actors and crew aren‚Äôt POC‚Ä¶. Barking and staring at everyone walking in and out of a building that I pay $3000 a month for for over several years. 

There have been a lot of movies filmed on my street in the past but never has any film crew ever encroached on the lives of tenants. This all just seems very wrong and unfair and the least thing that Netflix should have don‚Äôt was notify the tenants that they were:

1. Defacing our beautiful building and covering it in graffiti 
2. On filming day there would be crew members and actors walking in and out of our lobby. 
3. That tenants would have to basically ask permission to enter and exit a building that we pay to live in. 

Like imagine walking home one afternoon and then seeing you while building changed a different color and then vandalized. It was a horrible sensation. I am the one having to actually live here and my day to day lifestyle isn‚Äôt some fabricated netflix aesthetic for their commodity. 

Has anyone else in NYC or LES ever experienced this? Do I have any rights as a tenant?"

Hey there, Reddit! There's never much going on in our little neighborhood of Bensonhurst so here's an event idea (not planned yet) for a day in the upcoming 20 days. 

For dinner, which we're definitely having, it would be at Sake Sushi AYCE by the D train. 

For billiards, it would be Gotham City Billiards on Ave U.

For dessert, it would be Prince Tea House or Mango Mango.

For just dinner and billiards, it would be roughly under 40 dollars at the minimum pp and 2-2.5 hours in total. (Accounting for an hour each and walking time.)

For just dinner and dessert (one dessert, one drink?) , it would be roughly under 50-60 dollars pp at the minimum and 1.5-2 hours in total. 

For all three combined in one hectic, fun 3-4 hour schedule, it would be roughly under 60-70 per person. 

  
These are all rough estimates and stated higher just in case. Please comment if it's something you'd be interested in this idea, which combination you prefer best, any suggestions, etc.

  
I'd like to use this post to start inner-neighborhood exploration for hidden gems and new friends, and to inspire others in our neighborhood of Bath Beach / Bensonhurst and other surrounding areas, who are semi-tired of going to northern Brooklyn and Manhattan all the time for fun events, to do the same.

My main reason is because there's just no good specialty cafe's in the area and I grew up around Bensonhurst so I honestly just want to give back to the community in a way I'm passionate about. I should mention, they want to open around Brighton Beach as it has more foot traffic. The way I see it, Bensonhurst has more loyal foot traffic but that isn't enough for them :/

Edit: When I say give back I mean I want to provide coffee that I believe anyone from coffee enthusiasts to people wanting a quick coffee can enjoy

Bensonhurst,0.97,"Hey guys, I saw a post recently about how someone was looking to find things to do/make friends in Bensonhurst/Bay Ridge/Dyker/Bath Beach. I noticed a lack of community for younger folks in their 20s/early 30s here. Even though I grew up here/still live here, I don't know a single person who is in my age group here lol..

So I figured why not make a reoccurring monthly or even bi-weekly social where folks can meet and know others in their age bracket in our hidden oasis.

I would like to organize bar hangs / dinners / picnics / overall just reoccurring social events for young adults in the area to get to know each other and build a community of sort. I have experience doing this in a fashion oriented space so I think it could work!

Let me know if you would be down for these type of things! TY"

Hello, my husband and I were visiting Brooklyn (where he‚Äôs from) last week. On Monday 8/12 we took an Uber from the Ave H station on the Q train line on Ave H and East 16th street to a tattoo shop near Ave N and Flatbush Ave. The Uber was a white minivan and I was seated in the back behind the driver. I‚Äôm pretty sure I lost my ring in that Uber. If you were in there after we were and you found my ring, or if you know someone who did, I would gladly pay a cash reward for it! We have followed up with Uber and every place we went since leaving that day but so far we haven‚Äôt tracked down the ring.

It is a gold engagement ring with a square stone in the center and two smaller darker triangular stones on either side. This ring is incredibly sentimental to me and means more than I can put into words. I‚Äôve been devastated since realizing it‚Äôs gone.

We went to Tzarline Tattoo Studio briefly, on Avenue N off Flatbush, then Bullseye Sports Pub on Flatbush Avenue and Avenue P. Then we went to Lenny &amp; John‚Äôs Pizza on Flatbush Ave between Avenue P and Flatlands Ave, before taking the B82 bus to the Kings Highway Q Train Station back to Avenue H.

Again it is a three stone engagement ring, which I can provide pictures of and any info leading to tracking it down would be very much appreciated!! I know it‚Äôs a long shot but I can‚Äôt imagine losing this ring, it means so much to me, so please if you‚Äôve found it or heard about someone else finding it, let them know we‚Äôd be happy to reward them if they can return it!

Thank you!!!"

DitmasPark,0.5,"This post is not an invitation to spew Islamophobia.

I‚Äôve noticed over the last six months to a year a sudden and significant increase in the number of women walking around completely covered from head to ankle, except for a narrow slit for partial vision. There have always been many women in the neighborhood who wear head scarfs/ hijabs, but seeing Taliban-occupied-Afghanistan style Burkas, Iranian style chadors has become the norm lately. My questions are, are people becoming stricter about what women are wearing? Are these women new arrivals, and if so, from where? Are these people who have converted to Islam and are more strict than more long-term followers? As I said, this is not an invitation to spew Islamophobia. I have tried to say hi to several veiled women.  I cannot see their eyebrows or mouths so I do not know if they heard me. It diminishes a sense of community when a large number of people are veiled to the point that society can‚Äôt communicate with them. 

If people are cruel or rude in the comments, I‚Äôll delete the post. "

I made a few searches and it turns out this is a quite frequent annoyance around southern Brooklyn. Noise is generally a big problem here but this one is very bad, at least for me. Can anyone else hear it or is it just me?"

I'm a 30+/f recently moved to Dyker Heights from Queens. What cool places should I check out in the neighborhood and surrounding area? Would love to find bars, social events, anything interesting.

How is the smell now?

How is Owl's Head Park?

2) What is the best way to commute to Mid-Town? I hear a lot of people say the Express Bus is the way to go.

BayRidge,0.75,"Has anyone else noticed the increasing presence of homeless individuals on 3rd Avenue between Bay Ridge Parkway and 74th street? They usually camp on a bench in front of the Key Foods or on the stoop adjacent to ICE Deli. A middle aged man with shoulder length dirty blond hair and a larger ethnic woman with curly hair have been loitering on this stretch of third avenue for approximately 6 months. The guy doesn't seem to bother anyone, but his companion aggressively panhandles passersby. She often asks for change, and if you decline she'll ask for a larger denomination. It's constant and becoming a nuisance ever since their group has grown by a few individuals in the past month or so. They often seem a little out of it (drugs?) and I've seen EMT's respond to their location a few times. A few days ago I saw one of them wander into a nearby apartment building while the main door was propped open (looked like a new tenant was moving in on the 1st) which was concerning. While I have no reason to believe a crime was committed (other than trespassing) it's apparent they are in need of money. Bottom line is I hope they receive whatever help they need, but also wish they wouldn't loiter on this busy stretch of 3rd Avenue anymore, regularly asking families and locals for money. "

ForestHills,0.9,"Hi, we live nearby but have never gone trick or treating in Forest Hills. I‚Äôve seen Burns mentioned, can anyone give me an idea of where the trick or treat friendly area starts ? Thanks!"
ForestHills,1.0,"Hi neighborhood friends!

I rent an apartment in one of the co-ops, but my apartment is under a different management from the building (some others are similar). Since moving in, I've complained about my upstairs neighbor ignoring the noise ordinance. However, at this point, management has stopped responding about any solutions because the person is still loud at all hours, blasting their terrible music, their TV, video games, stomping around in what sounds like their shoes, and no rugs on 80% of their apartment. 

I've lived in another co-op with family before and grew up in NYC apartments. Dealing with noise issues was easy because we had management and security onsite who could deal with it at that moment, and neighbors were easy to talk to about their noise level. Here, it's way less helpful, and I'm at my end with this and just want to report it to the city. 

I work from 7:30 AM and take classes in the evening online, and it's exhausting not to feel fully rested because of someone being unneighborly. 

  
What are your thoughts and suggestions for dealing with this? I refuse to talk to the neighbors because they are not approachable. I instead want to go through the paper trail channels."
ForestHills,1.0,Hey everyone! Any recommendations for dermatologists in the area? 
ForestHills,0.82,"Hey guys!

I'm considering a move to Forest Hills. Even though I've never been to the area, I have read and seen a bunch of videos that makes it seen like a place I would enjoy living in and it seems pretty affordable, compared to other areas. I am a new grad, so not completely sure about the demographics in the area. I'm aware its mostly families but if there's still a descent amount of young people living in the area, that would be cool too.

I've seen people mention that with the LIRR and an express bus, its easy &amp; fast to get to midtown. So my question is more related to the financial district because even tho getting to midtown may be fast, what about all the way to the lower west side? Is it too far? What about late at night, is it slower?

  
Another VERY important thing for me: safety! I know its one of the ""safest"" areas of queens (perhaps of NYC) but are there any areas while I look for an apartment that I should avoid? Specially if I may get home late sometimes and I would rely on public transportation.

ForestHills,0.43,"I‚Äôve lived in Forest Hills, Yellowstone Boulevard, specifically for 2 years. My building is half a seniors home and half a daycare center! I moved during the tail end of the pandemic so I couldn‚Äôt see all my neighbors but I never imagined it would be so apparent that no one is in my age range (40s), demographic (brown), and single with no kids. I have not met any friendly neighbors, not 1 friend, and my social life has come to a screeching halt. The food scene is sub-par, deliveries are insanely long (an hour), and the stores and buildings look ancient. Oh yes, there‚Äôs a Trader Joe‚Äôs. Because we don‚Äôt have enough double parking, traffic jams, and hordes of people walking and crossing everywhere. I had my hair done at Estelle‚Äôs Salon and they butchered my hair. Half of my hair fell out, and I‚Äôm still trying to recover from it. I had my nails done at Gigi Salon and they damaged my nails so badly it took 6 months before they were finally hard and healthy nails again. I don‚Äôt know any redeeming qualities about living here. I know there‚Äôs communities and groups you can join but I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust anyone or feel anyone has a genuine bone in their body. I feel like I stepped into the twilight zone. Does no one else have a problem living here but me? 
EDIT: Thank you to the kind people who responded with good advice and feeling the same as I do. It really made me feel less alone being here. To the less friendly responders, what did I expect if I get this same treatment IRL? There are rude, nasty people everywhere and moving out is not always the proven solution. I own a co- op so I can‚Äôt leave just like that. If I had a bad experience at a salon, why not advise of a better one? Why not ask which food places I‚Äôve tried?

I heard Dylans had live music (seemed mostly singer songwriters) but I unfortunately hadn't checked it out before they closed. Are there other venues in the area? I'd also love to find a place to buy records and if I'm being really greedy, a good local music shop for gear/instruments. (Sam Ash was the only thing I knew of like that and they're closed now). My gf is on the hunt for a book store, art supplies shop (there's Michaels which is fine in a pinch, but really caters more towards crafts and home decor), and a gallery to check out art. (We've recently discovered Yant does events which has been an extremely good get for the neighborhood).  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'd love to hear about any resources you know of for music/art in the neighborhood.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Edit:**  
Here's my shortlist of Forest Hills food/bev spots that I like so far (for those who happen to care):  
# Dine In  
- Dirty Pierre's - name is salacious and beer list isn't great if you're a nerd about that sort of thing, but the food is ON POINT. The fare is simple and crowd-pleasing, but the kitchen does *everything* right. This is the sort of place created by someone who cut their teeth in very serious kitchens but wanted to do something more casual and fun. Hands down, some of the best food in the neighborhood. The mussels (with extra bread) and the chicken sandwich are favorites (add toppings to tastre), but they do everything extremely well. This is not ""good for Forest Hills"". This is a solid casual food spot for NYC in general.   
- Boulangerie de Francoise - One of the few places in the neighborhood that I'd pit against any other spot in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Legit French bakery that makes me feel like people are crazy for going to Martha's or Duncan Donuts when this absolute gem exists in the neighborhood. I've never had anything bad here though aside from the occasional brunch crepe or croque monsieur, this is usually the place my gf and I get a coffee and pastry at. They easily make the best coffee in the neighborhood, the only place to buy fresh bread, and literally pick *any* pastry from the display case and you'll have your socks knocked off. Fruit items are fresh and zesty, cream pastries are decadent but somehow don't feel too rich, everything is crispy and delicate and nuanced...Francoise is an artist and the fact that this place isn't written about more is a crime. This is a place that cares about details and it shows.  
- Tamashii Ramen - Decent ramen spot. I wouldn't pit this against spots in Flushing or Brooklyn or Manhattan, but it's the best Ramen I've found in the neighborhood and the staff is friendly. Favorite ramen is the Kara Veggie Miso Ramen (I'm not a vegetarian, but trust me on this. I'll usually add chasyu pork slices). The appetizers can be hit or miss. I'd skip the pork buns. The Agadashi Tofu is kinda cool, and the Takoyaki is solid. The sake list is perfectly serviceable as is the Sapporo.  
- Cafe Keuka - Closest thing to a legit wine bar that we have here. The wine list is solid. Food is pretty good. I'd typically treat it more like a tapas place...get a few glasses of wine, share some cheese and meat, and maybe a few other small plates. I wish they'd turn the TVs off and put candles on the bar/tables, but the music is generally pretty good and like I said, good wine selection.  
- Tacombi - Yeah it's a chain, but the food is really good, the ambiance is comfortable, and the service staff is really friendly. The seafood tacos are among my favorites. Shrimp Tacos and Baja Crispy Fish tacos are my go to orders as are the guacamole con totopos. Chips are made in house and the guac is simple but made *perfectly*.  
- Nick's Bistro - Solid old-school NYC bistr. ? The food is comforting and filling. It's not the sort of place for best of the best NYC eating, but if you want the type of food you may have eaten when going out with your family when you were a kid with generous portions, then this can be a fun sort of nostalgia spot. Friendly old-school NY hospitality, and solid hearty fare. When they're in season, definitely get the softshell crab sandwich. That's something I'd make a special trip for. Also, be careful with ordering if you typically do both appetizers and entree. The portions are generous and my experience is that most things could be shared.  
- Oktoberfest Manor - Not really Forest Hills, but if you can venture out a bit, this is a *really* great German Pub. All of their food is good, and they have a *great* beer list. We tend not to go there as often simply because it's a bit of a walk (we don't have a car and honestly, because it's not right in front of our face, we tend to forget about it) but it ends up working out since we usually need to waddle back home with bellies filled with beer and good German food...the light exercise makes us feel a little bit better about our inevitable over-indulgence.  
- Cobblestones - Not my personal favorite, but can be fun. The burger/fries are pretty good. Fried pickles are perfectly serviceable (not the best in the city, but when dining close to home, I definitely won't sneeze at them). For the type of beer garden/hall space that it is, the beer list is almost entirely macro breweries which is a shame. I really wish they had a few smaller local beers available. 
&amp;nbsp;  

# Take Out
- Austin Street Pizza - Great slice shop and pretty banging pizza. Their sauce is great and I've yet to have a bad slice there. The crust on their pizzas is thick, but delicious and not the sort of thing I'd typically eat around unless I was REALLY stuffed. I'll eat slices on the go here and there, but usually we get a pie and walk it back to the apartment for a night in.  
- Beijing Dumpling - Unassuming but legit. The dumplings are obviously delicious, but the veggie noodles are pillowy and decadent and I'd be very surprised if they weren't made in house. It's hard to preserve that sense of soft chew with frozen or dried noodles so if it's not fresh pasta, they definitely fooled me. I usually order the veggie fried noodles with shrimp. (I'm not a huge fan of the dan dan noodles.) The Sesame Pancake is also great, as are the spicy wontons. And fried pork dumplings are classic. The 30 frozen dumplings are also a great deal if you want to just keep some on hand in the freezer for a quick meal.  
- Sakura Ya - Japanese grocery store but holy crap - their prepared food is amazing! All of their onigiris are banging. My favs are the teriyaki chicken (RIP the fried chicken), and spicy salmon. Honorable mention to the shrimp tempura and spicy shrimp tempura. My gf loves the spam/egg one. That said, all of them are good. Also love the shrimp shumai, the chicken/pork dumplings, and the beef bulgagi bowls. If you go there often, make sure to ask to get a stamp card.  
- Angel's Indian Restaurant - A little pricey, but well worth the cost. This is closer to the sort of authentic Indian food you'd get from a home cook as opposed to the typical ""restaurant"" fare. It's not uncommon that estimated delivery times have been pushed back from this place so order accordingly. I think they run lean with staff so if it's particularly busy things slow down a bit.  
- Homemade Taqueria - I don't know what this place does to their chicken, but it's really good. Favorites are the chicken quesadilla (with corn tortilla), the Mexicana torta, the chicken burrito, and the chorizo tostada. If you need a side, the rice and beans are solid (not a MUST HAVE, but if you are hungry and need a little something extra, they're good). I'd skip their fries, and the beef offerings have been underwhelming.  
- Bund - Best soup dumplings nearby. In truth, ALL their dumplings are good. The spot can be a bit pricey and I'd honestly skip most of their other offerings. Get anything dumpling related. Soup dumplings, wontons, etc. You'll get the best bang for your buck and it's what they're best at. Most other stuff we've tried from there is okay at best, but not necessarily worth the cost.  
- Village Diner - Again...this is probably more Kew Gardens, but this place is probably one of the best diners nearby. Classic diner food. In recent years, it's gotten a little more expensive (as everywhere has to cover margins), but it's probably the best diner food anywhere near here.  

# Drinks  
If you're a booze nerd, this can be a bit more tough.  

- Nemo's - Best beer spot in the neighborhood. Lot's of cans you can buy to go (or drink on premises), and a constantly rotating draft list. All their beers are served in multiple sizes which is great if you want to taste a bunch of stuff or do a nightcap but don't want to necessarily commit to a full 16/12 ounces. If you're a beer nerd, this is the place to be. While it's not the place to go specifically for dinner, the food options are also pretty good with soft pretzels, a few types of grilled cheese (with beer cheese), a corned beef sandwich, etc. . I hope they make tons of money so they can buy a bigger space and have a proper bar/pub. The current space is pretty small and on 'busy' nights you may find yourself standing with a pint in front of a fridge. People are really friendly there so it's not a big deal, but this is the sort of thing I'd like to see be able to expand in the neighborhood.  
- Cafe Keuka - Wine bar. Mentioned in the dine-in section, but the wines easily outshine the food here. If you want a glass (or a bottle), this is the place to go. Solid list and unpretentious. So many other spots flip the ratio where the list is laughable and overpriced yet they clearly sniff their own farts when it comes to their list. This is the sort of place where you can find a surprisingly banging list but the staff doesn't make a big deal out of it.  
- Unfortunately I haven't found a good spot for spirits/cocktails yet. I've tried Station House. It looks great on paper, but doesn't quite hit the mark when it comes to execution. I also don't know if that's the sort of thing that the neighborhood would care about or financially support, so that may be a losing battle.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I'm not mentioning this because I think I have the best ideas about anything, but hoping to stimulate a conversation. Feel free to disagree with me or suggest things I've missed. Forest Hills surprises me every day."

Last night, I had one make it's way into my apartment. I have been panicking and knocked on my super's door at like 1am. 
I know other apartments have roaches and mice, but I take serious precautions and do not have any. 
I'm so incredibly upset. I know that's a growing issue of rats in the city, and they have been an issue in Forest Hills, but I thought I was safe in my little corner of Rego Park üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ "
RegoPark,0.5,"In late August 2024, I encountered this dog owner for the first time on Alderton in Rego Park. He &amp; his dogs blocked the sidewalk and forced me to go around him while mouthing off unclear rubbish as if he is on drugs. He then had his dogs trespass on my lawn, and when I demanded he get off, his dogs began snarling, lunging, and barking murder threats at me. He then proceeded to trespass on my driveway, his second tresspass, and even called for reinforcements against me at the same time that I was calling 911 on him. He even tried to pick a fight using his murderous dogs with an unrelated party walking through. He stayed outside and mouthed off unclear obscenities, and insults/demands for quite a while, all while the police hadn't arrived. He even shouted unclear obscenities at me from his vehicle, meaning he is apparently operating it while drunk or on drugs, and then drove off. When the police came, they said they will be outside my house for a while, but since the perpetrator likely didn't return so soon, this did not result in further action.

(Second Day):
I crossed him on Alderton again in the dark night. Because it was dark and he did not have his dogs, and had suitcases instead, I didn't even realize it was him until about when we already walked past each other, and when I started a recording of this encounter.

He (a) said he will kill me (b) repeatedly said he will fuck me up and (c) swore on his mother that he will do these things once he gets back from his trip. At least half of this is recorded on video. He even taunted me, saying to call the police again. It appears this is not his first time committing crimes and having the police do nothing, hence his confidence.
I do, and I also follow him, updating the police on his location so he can be detained before he goes on the trip, so he can't come back and kill me or ""fuck me up"". Not every 911 operator even cooperates. He goes all the way to a Rego Park subway station by the store ""Vision World"", and about when he swipes in, the police arrive. I get the police's attention right away, but the police officers who arrive on this day try to argue instead of using this opportunity to detain him. While the police rant, he surely has boarded a train and leaves. The police then walk with me to the station like I had been asking them to do, but he and one woman with him are already gone, on their trip. I demanded a restraining order, and was told by a cop that he doesn't do that. 

The fact that he is still roaming free despite clear murderous intent, and sworn statements that he will fuck me up and kill me is abhorrent, and even does warrant 911 calls should you have any further information of prior crimes or killings committed by this unhinged man. If you have encountered this man, I need to know anything you have on him. The fact that he knows where I live means he could kill my entire family too, as soon as he gets back on the 5th. He is far from the only dog owner who does such things and is praised instead of punished for it.

I have attempted to reach neighbors about this guy but no one who answered their door knew who this domestic terrorist is. While I do know a couple of details about his relatives and family that I spoke to, none of that information is of any use, except that he is stated to return to Queens on 09/05/24, when, as he swore to do, he will proceed to rape and kill me. Although he is targeting a man for this, I am certain he is mainly going after any sort of kid much more often. Every encounter with this unhinged perverted man wears me out immensely due to medical conditions I have been battling, and likely gives him immense pleasure."
JacksonHeights,0.82,"The salmon and catfish at the Foodtown 37th and 78th look roughly handled. Harshly butchered.  Even bruised.

The Mi Terra on 80th and Northern, I‚Äôm uncertain.

Everything else other markets is prepackaged from a different location.  Either not fresh, or has been unfrozen for some time.

The fish at Fruit Dollar Up large Korean market almost underneath the Woodside 61st street is great fish (and produce!)

But is a bit far.

Same with the two localish H Marts.

I can‚Äôt believe! that instead of an Asian market, Jackson Heights just got a (bleech) Pizza Hut.

These losers (primarily two brothers, both are really tall)  appeared over the past years and have made diversity plaza their turf. They sit in office chairs, openly drink and harass/catcall/throw objects at any attractive woman that passes by. I tried reporting them to local precinct but they didn't do anything.

JacksonHeights,0.95,"Hi all, 

JH native here excited to finally be in a place where I can buy my own home in my neighborhood. However, looking at apartments available for sale here my monthly estimates on real estate websites are thrown off because they don't include the HOA fees - which is anywhere from $800-$1300/mo and feels insane to me. 

As I understand it the fees go to maintenance but having lived in one of these buildings the last five years I've been doing virtually all the maintenance that comes up myself so it feels kind of awful to be paying so much monthly. To those of you who own here and pay the HOA fee, what has your experience been and what can you tell me about it? I'm trying to steel myself for any future costs and google just gives me information for HOA fees in states with suburban neighborhoods. 

Thanks in advance!

JacksonHeights,0.92,"This evening, my wife and I were walking around the Jackson Heights area on 75th Street, between 37th Rd and 35th Ave, when a tall Sikh gentleman in his 60s, wearing a turban and sporting a full beard, called out to us. He asked if we were Punjabi in Hindi, and although we aren't, I tried to respond in Hindi as best as I could.

The man asked several personal questions about us and our family while offering random life advice. He carried a black notebook filled with cut-out papers and what looked like a visiting card. As he talked, he scribbled something on a small piece of paper, crumpled it, and handed it to me, asking me to hold it in my palm without looking.

Then, he asked me to name the first flower that came to my mind. Caught up in the moment, I said ""rose."" He told me to open the paper‚Äîand to my surprise, ""rose"" was written on it. Soon after, he started asking for money, and although I was ready to walk away, my wife insisted on giving him a little something.

This was a very strange and unexpected experience for us, something we've never encountered before in Jackson Heights. Has anyone else faced a similar situation? Just wanted to share with the Jackson Heights community and hear your thoughts! Thank you."

JacksonHeights,0.93,"I am very interested in exploring cultures and their celebrations/neighborhoods.  For example, on 4/20 when NYC opened up several streets to pedestrians only, one of those was the Songkran festival or Thai new year.  I only happened to find this because I explored 3 of the opened streets and this was one of them.  I would like a more systematic way to be aware of such events, ideally across new york.  But if not that, then at least in Jackson Heights/Elmhurst since these are huge multicultural centers.  But I wasn't able to find a ""Jackson Heights calendar.""  It would be massive information overload if I tried to find every one of the 100+ cultures in JH and pull up a holiday calendar for each!  Please help!  Thanks."

Woodside,0.5,"We spoke to our friend today.  She checked out Madison York Assisted Living did not like it, It is a terrible place no privacy and you have to have a roommate She is not interested in sharing an apartment.  She can't find another apartment under $2,000 She doesn't qualify for Section 8.  She had 2 home attendants one used to steal her laundry detergent and the other used to steal her charms off her charm bracelet.  What aggravates me about this situation is when the landlord could use her for 3 years, they did now they don't need her they want to throw her in the street.  She went to court September 4th and the landlord already had a marshal scheduled for September 20th.  Judge put a stop on that and gave her continuance until October.  Her friend told her about the Coalition for Homeless they paid her landlord $25,000 and she told her they found her another apartment but the woman our friend talked to said they don't find you apartments.  Senior Housing have years long waiting lists.  She is on lists for a quite a few.  He is going to go to a realtor she knows and see if he can help her."
Woodside,0.33,"Here is a story about how people use other people when they need them but when you need them, they tell you go F yourself.  We have a friend who rents a 5-room apartment in Middle Village.  She only pays $700 a month but she always pays her rent every month The old lady her first landlord passed away and left the house to both her children one who lives in the house did not want to sell the house while their child was still in school here and they could not afford to buy out their sibling. They used our friend as an excuse too.  She is elderly and right after COVID she found out she had cancer How could they evict her.  2022 the child graduated from high school so then they didn't need her started eviction proceedings.  Judge kept siding with our friend.  In 2019 she applied for senior housing but is still on waiting list for several places.  I told her my next door waited at least 10 years to get into senior housing in Corona.  All while this is going on she is still paying her rent.  I know a lot of tenants that stop paying their rent when the landlord tells them they want them out.  The judge told her if the landlord refuses the rent because they want you out put it in a bank account do not spend it.   Last September they went to court she got another year long extension.  To get back at her the landlord said she says she is so sick how come she still smokes.  She sits on the front steps and smokes we cannot open our windows because the smoke comes in. The judge barred her from sitting on the stoop she found a neighbor who lets her smoke on their stoop.  She contacted the Coalition for the Homeless for help they said they can only refer her to homeless shelters for women and if she has to go to 1 they can help her find storage.  She never had a lease and does not owe back rent so they can't help her.  Both her sons have a wife and medical needs, so they won't take her in.  I suggested to her going into an assisted living, but they will take her check.  She likes to spend her money the way she wants to.    The coalition told her if she goes into a shelter, she can get a housing voucher I don't think she will survive inn a shelter.  70 plus years old and has cancer.  Any ideas how to help her?"

Woodside,0.88,"Life isnt a ‚ÄòTiny Homes‚Äô episode. Developers need to hear this. ANY APARTMENT YOU DESIGN IN NYC SHOULD HAVE A COAT CLOSET. We don‚Äôt want to put coats with the clean bedroom closet. It‚Äôs nasty. And those of us who can afford luxury, we don‚Äôt own just the two coats to leave on coat racks. It‚Äôs crazy. 

I‚Äôm angry that in my search I am forced into the most disturbing compromises while leaving all my money on the table.

I am frustrated that apartments I LOVE and want to buy I soon realize are impractical by just a couple of feet because if your greed. 

It needs to stop being a normal standard that it‚Äôs acceptable to make apartments under 600 sqr feet. 
It‚Äôs not a college dorm.
 
And then we have the fact that luxury is overpriced and will appreciate SLOW in these areas. So anyone who wants to commit needs to just stay in their chosen shoe box for the next 10 years if they hope to just break even when they sell. 

The American dream is being destroyed and it‚Äôs not just by our government it‚Äôs the choices of these greedy developers. I‚Äôm frustrated and angry with my search. I‚Äôm frustrated that even with all my income and savings after all this hard work and being nearly 40, I can‚Äôt afford anything that isn‚Äôt a gross compromise. Either a compromise where I have to pay 6-8k mortgage/tax/CC - for any normal sized apt that would rent for half. 

Does it even make sense to own anymore. 
This process literally makes me want to leave NYC.

Woodside,0.44,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm torn between investing in a luxury condo in Woodside, specifically The Arcadia Woodside. The Arcadia's proximity to public transport justifies the higher cost... or so I think.
But is it worth buying at that price point in this particular neighborhood?? 


My concerns:

1. Resale value: With so many condos offering more space at half the price, will I be able to sell for a profit or even break even?
2. Depreciation: Could the property actually lose value over time given that the value is the luxury new finished.
3. Area appreciation: Is Woodside a growing neighborhood or am I overpaying for a luxury condo in a less coveted area?

Pros:

1. The Arcadia is a gem, offering better quality and amenities than what I can afford in more desirable areas.
2. Woodside's quieter atmosphere and easy access to public transport appeal to me.

Cons:

1. Price point: Am I paying too much for the luxury?
2. Uncertainty: Will the area appreciate or depreciate in value?

Redditors, share your wisdom! Have any of you invested in luxury condos in Woodside or similar areas? What were your experiences? Should I take the plunge or explore other options?

Help a worried investor out!"

Ridgewood,0.81,"I have a friend who lives in Glendale she helps 8 seniors with food for them and their pets.  She used to go get food for them from Fenix but now they want her to wait online like everyone else or they will call her if they have any food left after the line is gone.  Someone told her to go get the seniors food at a senior center on Myrtle Ave near Fresh Pond Road, but you have to be a member there to get help.  Council woman Joann Ariola is giving out Thanksgiving meals so she signed up the seniors who can't cook for themselves and live in her district for one.  She is looking for turkeys' giveaways some seniors can cook for themselves so she will give them one.  If you know of any food giveaways let me know.  Councilman Holden gives out pet food once in a while, but he only gives to people in his district, and you have to show proof.  Most of Glendale is now in Ariola's district.  Assemblyman Raga gave out turkeys last year if you lived in his district or Congresswoman Grace Meng's district, but I haven't heard if he is doing it again this year.  "

Ridgewood,0.28,"Hi Ridgewood! The *dine well supper club* is a new farm-to-table, queer and woman-run, roving supper club concept; we aim to center traditional cuisines not usually presented in a fine dining context (trad foods, not trad values!), feature seasonal ingredients from local purveyors, and pay homage to each NYC neighborhood we pop up in.

On Sunday November 3rd, we're bringing the second edition of *dine well* to a secret location in Bushwick for a D√≠a de los Muertos themed dinner. Every ingredient in each of the four courses will be native to Mesoamerica- think pumpkin and squash, quelites, amaranth, yellowfin tuna, and of course corn- and we will have an ofrenda/altar set up with candles and space for photos if you wish to bring some. This is going to be a very special intimate evening with wonderful and thoughtful food, great company and immaculate vibes.

Who are we?! We are two Queens-based queer chefs (one of us is Mexican with Yucat√°n heritage and a Ridgewood resident!) who both hail from the SF Bay Area, the birthplace of farm-to-table cuisine. We are deeply inspired by locavorism, traditional cuisine from around the globe, and creating a warm and unpretentious dining experience in the spirit of joy and community &lt;3

Stationary appetizers will start at 6 and we will sit down for dinner at 6:30ish. Event is BYOB and we will recommend beverage pairings if you wish! Tickets are $125 per person with a limited number of discounted spots for neighborhood locals and folks for whom the price is prohibitive. To secure your spot, e-mail [hello@kaylasimonefowler.com](mailto:hello@kaylasimonefowler.com) or DM ksfchef on Instagram to receive instructions. We can't wait to dine well with you!!"

I've lived in the city for years, so I understand the realities of the subway and that ""safe"" means different things to everyone. 

My main station has been the Halsey J, and I've never felt particularly unsafe there, even later at night. I couldn't really find recent threads about the Dekalb L Station, but the little bit of discussion I found online made me question it (muggings, assault, someone having their bag grabbed when they wouldn't give someone money, etc.). 

I love the area, even though I know some parts are safer than others. I wish I had more time to be able to experience that subway stop for myself at different times of day/night, but can't realistically make that happen right now, so hoping someone might be kind enough to share their experience.

Astoria,0.91,"As title suggests. I‚Äôve tried Renis and Moa and wasn‚Äôt crazy about either (sour tasting). The best/affordable I‚Äôve tried so far was at the Barn Coffee Shop but they‚Äôre too far on foot. Any recs? 

ETA: idk if this is just standard but the place would need dairy free alternatives (almond, oat, etc!)"
Astoria,0.87,"Sidewalks, crosswalks are for ‚Ä¶.pedestrians. I get that from time to time there are emergencies or urgent reasons for officers to illegally park. But this behavior, not only here, but citywide is rampant. 

Yes, our transit systems need major upgrades and improvements. But how can we expect citizens to respect norms and laws, if our police departments act like this?

Again, I‚Äôm not anti-police. I just am for respect and fairness. Blocking a cross walk, and parking on sidewalks send a somewhat hostile IDGAF attitude, whether intentional or not. I don‚Äôt think any individual officer means any disrespect, this is just the culture and norms they have been allowed to operate from the highest level. "
Astoria,0.91,Is there a particular area in Astoria where the houses are decorated particularly well and worth visiting on Halloween? 
Astoria,0.96,"New cafe that just opened over the weekend off 29th and Astoria Blvd! Popped in out of curiosity yesterday and the menu has a lot of Asian inspired flavors, which I love- I got the hojicha latte which was delicious and the chocolate croissant was great too. I‚Äôm super curious about their specials as well as the only other place I‚Äôve seen Osmanthus was at a place in the Village. Staff was super nice too! Def worth checking out "

A little bit about me: I graduated Summa Cum Laude with my Masters degree as a scholarship student from Hunter College. 
I founded and created the dance program at PS17,¬†¬†I am the Bounding Boys teacher at The Ailey School, I‚Äôve contributed to dance curriculum at Ailey,¬†¬†¬†I taught at Rioult‚Äôs Dance Center before the pandemic closed it, I have my own dance company, and I am a freelance dancer. My dance education work has been focused in early childhood education. After leaving my job with the DOE to focus on my family, I‚Äôm branching out and teaching my young children‚Äôs curriculum on my own. (These dance classes focus on reinforcing brain-body connections through skill-based exercises, creative movement, and the joy of dance.)

Hope to see you and your littles soon!"

Astoria,0.57,"Hi I am going to join a gym. The closest one to me is Synergy but it is a bit too small and crowded for me. I went to club fitness a few years ago during the pandemic. The men's steam room was closed, no juice bar or classes. I know it is big enough but just wanted to crowd source current review of Club fitness.

Astoria,0.77,"Hi Astoria. I live in a spacious 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom with pets and children. Im looking to find a cleaner to do a deep clean of my entire apartment. (Mop, laundry, clean behind 
/under furniture, carpet cleaning, full bathroom cleaning, the dust that builds up in corners/moldings, etc). My apartment is not a disaster but doesn‚Äôt get enough attention lately because of how busy my family has been the past few months. What does a full cleaning like that cost on average? Does anyone have any cleaners to recommend? I never hired a cleaner so I don‚Äôt even know where to start.

Astoria,0.84,"Hi all,

A few years ago, I had a need for a clean MTA subway app, and most available apps had either a busy interface, were buggy, or provided way too many features for what I was looking for

Fast forward a few years - I released Catch It NYC for both Android and iOS - a straightforward app for navigating the subway system and helping you decide if you can catch that train! The latest update now has a dynamic subway map that will launch the tapped station, as well as a revamped subway status implementation

One of the unique features of my app is that you can see a lot realtime information for a train station at once (which is really helpful to understand if you can make that transfer, or quickly see when the next train is coming if you know you can't make the first one). Union Square example: [https://imgur.com/a/zQ3Rpyw](https://imgur.com/a/zQ3Rpyw)

Features include:

\* Favorited stations

\* Next three trains for a given line in one row (so that you don't have scroll among a sea of trains of the same color for the 2nd/3rd train when you know you are missing the 1st)

\* Status info

\* Nearby (nearest 5 stations with link out to Maps)

\* Dynamic subway map you can tap to launch station

MiddleVillage,1.0,"We spoke to our friend today.  She checked out Madison York Assisted Living did not like it, It is a terrible place no privacy and you have to have a roommate She is not interested in sharing an apartment.  She can't find another apartment under $2,000 She doesn't qualify for Section 8.  She had 2 home attendants one used to steal her laundry detergent and the other used to steal her charms off her charm bracelet.  What aggravates me about this situation is when the landlord could use her for 3 years, they did now they don't need her they want to throw her in the street.  She went to court September 4th and the landlord already had a marshal scheduled for September 20th.  Judge put a stop on that and gave her continuance until October.  Her friend told her about the Coalition for Homeless they paid her landlord $25,000 and she told her they found her another apartment but the woman our friend talked to said they don't find you apartments.  Senior Housing have years long waiting lists.  She is on lists for a quite a few.  He is going to go to a realtor she knows and see if he can help her."
MiddleVillage,0.66,"Here is a story about how people use other people when they need them but when you need them, they tell you go F yourself.  We have a friend who rents a 5-room apartment in Middle Village.  She only pays $700 a month but she always pays her rent every month The old lady her first landlord passed away and left the house to both her children one who lives in the house did not want to sell the house while their child was still in school here and they could not afford to buy out their sibling. They used our friend as an excuse too.  She is elderly and right after COVID she found out she had cancer How could they evict her.  2022 the child graduated from high school so then they didn't need her started eviction proceedings.  Judge kept siding with our friend.  In 2019 she applied for senior housing but is still on waiting list for several places.  I told her my next door waited at least 10 years to get into senior housing in Corona.  All while this is going on she is still paying her rent.  I know a lot of tenants that stop paying their rent when the landlord tells them they want them out.  The judge told her if the landlord refuses the rent because they want you out put it in a bank account do not spend it.   Last September they went to court she got another year long extension.  To get back at her the landlord said she says she is so sick how come she still smokes.  She sits on the front steps and smokes we cannot open our windows because the smoke comes in. The judge barred her from sitting on the stoop she found a neighbor who lets her smoke on their stoop.  She contacted the Coalition for the Homeless for help they said they can only refer her to homeless shelters for women and if she has to go to 1 they can help her find storage.  She never had a lease and does not owe back rent so they can't help her.  Both her sons have a wife and medical needs, so they won't take her in.  I suggested to her going into an assisted living, but they will take her check.  She likes to spend her money the way she wants to.    The coalition told her if she goes into a shelter, she can get a housing voucher I don't think she will survive inn a shelter.  70 plus years old and has cancer.  Any ideas how to help her?"

All of our work is done by hand on various whetstones, NOT on an electric grinder. While grinding is much faster and an ""old school"" way of doing it, you can seriously damage your knife. We do all styles of knives single or double bevel, German, Japanese, carbon steel, machetes, etc... always making sure to leave them in pristine condition. Send a private message to set up PICKUP and NEXT DAY drop off in your area or stop in to the shop 7 days a week to drop off. (Drop off before 1pm for same day pick up)
Thank you all for your taking the time to read this and if you know anyone in need of this service, please let them know.  We really appreciate it!"
BrooklynHeights,1.0,"Hello there! 

My partner and I are considering Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill for our move to NYC next year. 

We‚Äôve walked through Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill during the day and fell in love with it due to how much cleaner it is than other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. 

We also noticed that part of the reason why it‚Äôs so clean is there weren‚Äôt as many trash castles on the streets because of the trash enclosures/bins with lids on the outside of many brownstones. This was of course only during a short visit. 

How bad is the rat problem when walking in Brooklyn Heights after sundown? We have to walk our dog pretty late at night and don‚Äôt mind seeing a rat or two but want to avoid moving somewhere where the situation is too intense. 

Side note: I know every neighborhood in NYC has rats or mice or even roaches. Just trying to find a neighborhood that is cleaner and not as intense as the others. 

Thank you!

The **Mercury Association of Mail Art (MAMA)** is a constellation of people bound by a physical official address book. Its pages include mystics, artists, writers, silly people, and sacred people who love the slow, tactile process of exchanging mail. Each MAMA workshop brings art making into occult realms. This Aug 19 workshop will introduce us to the many faces of Mercury through a collage art project, channeled messages, rituals, and a pilgrimage to a mailbox. We will dive into the art history of the Mail Art movement (from Ray Johnson to Miranda July). We will sign our names to the official address book, reviving the anti-establishment art movement that went viral before social media.

EastVillage,0.63,"Traveler from up north visiting nyc for the first time. Have been here a few days and have encountered zero issues regarding payment or tipping at restaurants.
Visited Sobaya at 229 E 9th St for an early dinner. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt full; perhaps around five other tables when we entered. The usual ordering and food was all typical. Service was definitely below average with the employees ignoring us for water refills and there was an observable stark contrast in service. For example, the employee provided a very thorough explanation of drink options to the table next to us. While when speaking to my table, they had a short attitude as if they would rather be anywhere but there.
When we received the bill, we noticed an item was not on it and even mentioned it to the waitress before paying.
The problem arises after payment of bill and cash tip. A different waitress (not the same as the one that billed us) chased after us and stated that we did not tip enough. However, we have left a more than suitable and acceptable amount despite the horrible service provided. She spoke to us in an extremely derogatory manner as if I was dumb and did not understand tipping (note: tipping exists in Canada too). However in the heat of the moment, we handed over a couple more bills. During this interaction, she lectured us about how there was a law about how we had to tip them a certain percentage but none of us have ever heard of it. Despite our thorough research before visiting, we have not seen a single mention of this but became a bit unsure of whether there was such a thing. However she insisted that there was this tipping rule and even told us to google it if we wanted to in a very demanding and nasty tone. Even after we handed over the amount she wanted, she kept going on how this is how waiters survive here in a woe is me type of tone. 
Afterwards, we did extensive googling and have been unable to find anything about this ‚Äúrule‚Äù and I personally feel very uncomfortable with this entire experience which is why I decided to share this in hopes that no one else received this kind of experience. I also came up with two potential reasons as to why this happened. 1) my table spoke some Mandarin from time to time 2) we were tourists
If anyone does visit, I‚Äôd hope you have a lot of extra money to spend and enjoy bad service that you paid for. If you truly want to try it, avoid the waiter with shoulder-length hair who speaks with a Thai or Indonesian accent."
EastVillage,0.9,"It appears the entire East Village lost Spectrum internet and cable tv connectivity today. A pretty huge artery of their system must have been cut/failed, as our whole neighborhood was down for 7+ hours, judging by reports in our FB Group. I just learned (it wasn‚Äôt obvious in the agreement I signed) that my new, cheaper Verizon Wireless unlimited cell plan, does not allow me to tether/use my phone as a personal hotspot. #annoying"

EastVillage,1.0,"Hi everyone! I'm conducting a quick 2-minute, 5-question, multiple choice, anonymous survey for anyone who lives in New York City Metropolitan Area for a school project.

The questions are all multiple choice, and the topic is on whether or not you would consider using a service/amenity that would be exclusive to New York City residents. Feel free to leave any questions or critiques at the end! (Note if you aren't from NYC but live in a major city and would still like to participate please indicate which city you're located in before completing) Thank you so much!

I hope everyone has a great week!
